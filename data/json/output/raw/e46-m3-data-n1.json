            "This 2002 BMW M3 convertible is a nicely optioned example with just under 100k from new and a clean Carfax report. The drivetrain is stock with a number of recent service items addressed and no deferred maintenance. Blue Topaz Metallic paint over gray leather has been nicely maintained, and the car benefits from new brakes, new engine belts, and more detailed below. The seller says this does not look like a 13-year-old BMW, and the photo gallery below showcases the condition well. It is factory equipped with a 6-speed manual, cold weather package, bi-xenon headlights, and Harmon Kardon sound. Good colors, manual gearbox, and recent maintenance make this an attractive E46 M3.",
            "Topaz Blue paint is an attractive color and the body is all original and in excellent condition. The seller says there are not dents and minimal dings, mostly small paint chips as expected on the front spoiler.  The black canvas roof still looks new and the previous owner installed CSL carbon fiber front splitters. Stock 18\u2033 wheels are uncurbed with a clean factory finish and the rears wear new Bridgestone Potenza tires. Headlamp lenses are clear with no clouding.",
            "Dove grey leather is surprisingly clean for the mileage considering that this lighter interior tends to discolor with age. The seats have no tears tight bolsters. The original carpets, dashboard, and trim are in very good condition, and the optional cold weather package with heated seats is nice to have with the top down. Factory accessory M3 floor mats are a fine addition, and sale includes one original key and a newly programmed key from the dealer.",
            "Underhood, the S54 3.2L straight six is unmodified apart from a K&N intake and looks very clean. This is a fantastic powertrain with 333 horsepower and an 8,000 rpm redline. The car has recently benefitted from new brakes, new idle control valve, new belts, and new battery, and the car was serviced last year with full synthetic oil. The onboard computer says the next oil change is due in 10k miles.",
            "The car was purchased out of South Carolina and has been with the seller in Ohio for two years, always garaged in the winter months. The E46 M3 design has aged well and this car appears well preserved for a weekend or daily driver. Prior to the sellers\u2019 purchase he obtained a Carfax and PPI which are both viewable below."
