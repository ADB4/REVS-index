Highlighting the modifications is the Active Autowerke Stage 2 supercharger for the rebuilt 3.2-liter inline-six, which has forged internals and produced a peak output of 612.84 horsepower at the wheels after the build. Supporting modifications were performed to the subframe, suspension, braking, exhaust, and fuel systems, and it rides on 19\u2033 ZCP-style wheels and also is equipped with gray leather upholstery, front splitters, a six-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential, and more as described below. Now with 30k miles, this modified E46 M3 is offered in California at no reserve with records, spare parts, and a clean Montana title.",

The Stage 2 supercharger is from Active Autowerke and is intercooled, and ID1040 injectors, a methanol-injection system, a TiAL blow-off valve, an oil cooler, a 120mm crankshaft pulley and hub, and a 535 LPH fuel pump were installed. The car is currently tuned for E85 fuel, and the seller states that it can run on 91-octane and more.",
            "The engine was previously tuned by HTE Performance Tuning, at which time peak output was measured at 612.84 horsepower.

Finished in Jet Black over matching Nappa leather, the car is powered by a 3.2-liter inline-six linked with a six-speed SMG sequential transmission and a limited-slip differential. Factory equipment consists of the Premium Package, a black soft top, xenon headlights, heated power-adjustable front sport seats, navigation, and a Harman Kardon sound system. This E46 M3 is now offered with a clean Carfax report and a clean California title in the seller\u2019s name.",

Service under current ownership involved fluid services and replacement of the valve cover gasket, spark plugs, ignition coils, rear pinion seal, and engine and transmission mounts. The car is finished in Laguna Seca Blue over Grey Nappa leather and powered by a 3.2-liter inline-six linked to a six-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential. Features include 19\u2033 M double-spoke wheels, front sport seats, automatic climate control, cruise control, and a BMW Business CD stereo. This E46 M3 is now offered with manufacturer\u2019s literature, service records, a clean Carfax report, and a Massachusetts title.",

The suspension features H&R springs, Koni shocks, UUC sway bars, and Ground Control front adjustable camber plates, while the brakes were upgraded with Porsche 996 calipers, Euro CSL rotors, and stainless steel lines. The car is finished in Steel Grey Metallic over Cinnamon Nappa leather, and additional equipment includes the Premium and Cold Weather packages along with 19\u2033 M cross-spoke wheels, a power sunroof, a Euro front bumper, and an Alpine touchscreen head unit. This E46 M3 has 112k miles and is now offered with a window sticker, build records and photos, the owner\u2019s manual, and a clean Virginia title in the seller\u2019s name.",
            "The car is finished in Steel Grey Metallic (400) and is equipped with Shadowline trim and a Euro front bumper. The seller states the bumpers, side skirts, and lower headlight trim pieces have been refinished. Additional equipment includes xenon headlights, a glass sunroof, a trunk lid spoiler, and quad exhaust outlets. The rear Park Distance Control sensors are said to be unreliable. Paint meter readings taken around the body are provided at the end of the gallery.",

The car was factory equipped with Dynamic Stability Control (DSC), and braking is provided by Porsche 996 calipers over Euro CSL rotors with stainless steel lines at each corner. H&R sport springs and Koni shocks have been added, along with the following components:",

The pillar covers were also replaced and the center armrest was reupholstered in black with M tri-color stitching, which extends to the leather shift boot and parking brake boot. WeatherTech liners are fitted in the footwells, and additional sound deadening has reportedly been added below the carpets. The Alpine touchscreen head unit is wired to an Alpine four-channel amplifier, a JBL 8\u2033 powered subwoofer under the driver\u2019s seat, and Bavarian Sound Works speakers. The heated seats, cruise control, and traction control are inoperative.",
            "The multi-function steering wheel was re-trimmed under current ownership and frames a 185-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a variable redline along with gauges for coolant temperature, oil temperature, and fuel level. Speedhut oil pressure and oil temperature gauges have been added ahead of the shifter. The digital odometer indicates 112k miles, approximately 3k of which were added under current ownership.",
            "The 7.0L LS7 V8 crate engine was installed in June 2021 and features a wet sump conversion that utilizes a Holley oil pan, a Melling high-pressure oil pump, and a PowerBond Race Performance harmonic damper. Cooling is through a Koyorad aluminum radiator with a SPAL electric fan and a Mishimoto adjustable fan controller. The exhaust system incorporates Vorshlag long tube headers and 3\u2033 stainless steel pipes with Borla ProXS mufflers and a Magnaflow X-pipe, catalytic converters, and resonators.

            "This 2006 BMW M3 coupe was ordered new with the Competition Package, and it was registered in California until it was sold on BaT in August 2019. The six-speed SMG transmission was converted for manual operation before it was acquired by the selling dealer in 2021, and subsequent work consisted of reinforcing the rear subframe, upgrading the VANOS system, and replacing the rod bearings and assorted interior and exterior trim. Powered by a 3.2-liter inline-six, the car is finished in Interlagos Blue Metallic over black Nappa leather. It also has a limited-slip differential, 19\u2033 M cross-spoke wheels, Dinan rear exhaust components, a Dinan rear shock tower bar, a sunroof, automatic climate control, navigation, and Harman Kardon audio. Acquired by the current owner in 2021, this E46 M3 has 23k miles and is now offered on dealer consignment with manufacturer\u2019s literature, spare parts, a Carfax report, and a clean California title.",
            "The car is finished in Interlagos Blue Metallic (A30) and is equipped with Shadowline trim as well as fog lights, xenon headlights, rain-sensing windshield wipers, LED tail lights, a power-operated sunroof, a trunk lid spoiler, and quad Dinan-branded exhaust outlets. The Carfax report lists damage to the front and left-front portions of the vehicle in November 2021, and the front bumper cover is said to have been subsequently repainted. Paint protection film has been applied to the front end, and the kidney grilles were replaced under current ownership, according to the selling dealer. Paint meter readings are viewable in the gallery below.",
            "The 19\u2033 M cross-spoke Style 163M wheels are mounted with 225/40 front and 255/35 rear Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires that were reportedly purchased in March 2021. The ZCP Competition Package added an upgraded steering rack and larger cross-drilled brake rotors. The car was factory equipped with Dynamic Stability Control (DSC), and braking is provided by four-wheel ventilated discs.",
            "The cabin features heated power-adjustable front sport seats upholstered in black Nappa leather, and Milled-Effect Aluminum trim accents the dashboard and door panels. Interior amenities include automatic climate control, navigation, and a Harman Kardon sound system. The A-pillar panels and assorted interior trim pieces have been replaced.",

The digital odometer indicates 23k miles, approximately 1k of which were added under current ownership.",
            "The 3.2-liter S54 inline-six was factory rated at 333 horsepower and 262 lb-ft of torque. The double-VANOS system was upgraded and the connecting rod bearings were replaced in 2023, and the power-steering pulley was replaced time. Work performed in September 2023 consisted of an oil change and replacing the air conditioning compressor, valve cover gasket, idler pulley, power steering pump pulley, belt tensioner, serpentine belt, and intake manifold gaskets.",
            "Power is routed to the rear wheels via six-speed SMG transmission that was converted to manual operation under previous ownership. The car is also equipped with a limited-slip differential and Dinan rear exhaust components. The subframe was reinforced in 2023.",

The car is powered by a 3.2-liter inline-six linked with a six-speed SMG sequential transmission and a limited-slip differential and is finished in Silver Grey Metallic over black Nappa leather. Equipment includes 19\u2033 M double-spoke wheels, xenon headlights, Park Distance Control, heated power-adjustable front sport seats, a Harman Kardon sound system, and automatic climate control. Work completed under current ownership included adjusting the valves and replacing the rear trailing arm bushings, front struts, rear shocks, timing chain tensioner seal, drive belts, spark plugs, fuel filter, rear differential pinion seal, and differential mounts. This E46 M3 is offered at no reserve with manufacturer\u2019s literature, service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Michigan title.",
            "The car is finished in Silver Grey Metallic (A08) and was ordered without a sunroof or a trunk lid spoiler. Exterior details include Shadowline trim, xenon headlights, fog lights, rain-sensing windshield wipers, LED tail lights, Park Distance Control, quad exhaust outlets, and a trunk lid spoiler, the latter of which is said to have been added under current ownership. Under previous ownership, the front bumper cover and hood were refinished and the side marker lenses and fuel filler liner were replaced following the seller\u2019s acquisition. The windshield washer fluid pump and low-pitch horn do not work. Photographs of paint-meter readings are presented in the gallery.",

The car was factory-equipped with Dynamic Stability Control (DSC), and braking is provided by four-wheel ventilated discs. The rear trailing arm bushings, front struts, and rear shocks were replaced in 2023.",
            "The heated power-adjustable front sport seats are upholstered in black Nappa leather, and Titan Shadow trim adorns the dash and door panels. Interior amenities include cruise control, a BMW Business CD stereo, Harman Kardon audio, and automatic climate control. The steering wheel trim and the left and right door armrest trim were replaced in 2023, and the seller recommends replacing the A- and C-pillar trim. The glovebox flashlight does not work.",

The digital odometer indicates 22k miles, approximately 3k of which were added under current ownership.",
            "The 3.2-liter S54 inline-six was factory-rated at 333 horsepower and 262 lb-ft of torque. Work completed in 2023 included adjusting the valves and replacing the timing chain tensioner seal, drive belts, spark plugs, and fuel filter.",

            "This 2005 BMW M3 coupe is finished in Phoenix Yellow Metallic over black Nappa leather and is powered by a 3.2-liter inline-six linked with a six-speed SMG sequential transmission and a limited-slip differential. The car has been modified with Apex 18\u2033 alloy wheels, Alcon front brake calipers, a carbon-fiber CSL-style intake, KW coilovers, aftermarket exhaust components, an electric cooling fan conversion, a ZHP steering rack, Schroth front harnesses, and a carbon-fiber center console. Stock equipment includes the Premium and Cold Weather packages as well as a power sunroof, xenon headlights, navigation, a Harman Kardon sound system, and automatic climate control. Acquired by the seller in 2015, this E46 M3 has 96k miles and is now offered with service records, an accident-free Carfax report, and a clean Virginia title in the seller\u2019s name.",
            "The car is finished in Phoenix Yellow Metallic (445) and is fitted with Shadowline trim as well as xenon headlights, fog lights, black front kidney grilles, a glass sunroof, rain-sensing windshield wipers, LED tail lights, a trunk lid spoiler, and quad exhaust outlets. The roof has been wrapped in black vinyl. The parking sensors have been disabled and exterior imperfections include paint chips on the front end, scuffs on the front bumper, marks and paint touch-ups on the rear bumper cover and right mirror cap, and a dent above the right window.",
            "The 18\u2033 Apex FL-5 alloy wheels are mounted with 265/35 Michelin Pilot Super Sport tires that show 2016 production codes. The seller reports that KW Clubsport coilovers have been installed, and additional modifications include wheel spacers, A ZHP steering rack, and six-piston Alcon front brake calipers. The seller notes noise from the left-front brake rotor at low speed and states that the front rotors may need to be replaced.",
            "The heated power-adjustable front sport seats and door-panel inserts are upholstered in black Nappa leather, and Titan Shadow trim accents the cabin. A carbon-fiber CSL-style center console and Schroth front harnesses have been added, and additional interior amenities include driver-seat position memory, automatic climate control, cruise control, navigation, and Harman Kardon audio. Marks are visible in the soft-touch finish in front of the shifter, the A-pillar upholstery is loose, and additional photos of the interior condition are viewable in the gallery below.",
            "The multi-function leather-wrapped steering wheel features M-color stitching and frames a 185-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a variable redline along with gauges for coolant temperature, oil temperature, and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 96k miles, approximately 25k of which were added under current ownership. The seller notes that the \u201cService Engine\u201d light has been illuminated since the aftermarket exhaust components were installed.",
            "The 3.2-liter S54 inline-six has been fitted with a carbon-fiber CSL-style intake. The double-VANOS system was upgraded with a Besian Systems seal kit and oil pump disc under current ownership. The seller notes that an electric radiator fan conversion was installed in 2017, and that assorted cooling hoses were replaced at that time. A Blackstone oil analysis report from July 2021 is viewable in the gallery.",
            "Power is routed to the rear wheels via a six-speed SMG sequential transmission and a limited-slip differential. The catalytic converters have been removed, and the seller reports that a Rogue Engineering electronic exhaust cutout valve and exhaust components were fitted under current ownership.",
            "The Carfax report shows no accidents or other damage and lists registration history in Virginia and Michigan. The report lists an open manufacturer safety recall for the front-right airbag in a January 2020 entry."

The engine has been converted to a single-turbocharger system, and equipment includes a front-mount intercooler, a custom exhaust system, a front strut tower brace, and a PureTech rear X brace. The car is finished in Jet Black over Black Nappa leather, and BMW features include a limited-slip differential, the Competition Package, 19\u2033 M cross-spoke wheels, a power sunroof, xenon headlights, power-adjustable front sport seats, and automatic climate control. The selling dealer acquired the car in 2022 and they report that the fluids were changed in preparation for the sale. This Toyota-powered BMW is now offered at no reserve in California with a clean Massachusetts title.",
            "The car is finished in Jet Black and features Shadowline trim, xenon headlights, fog lights, a glass sunroof, rain-sensing windshield wipers, LED tail lights, a trunk lid spoiler, and quad exhaust outlets. The selling dealer states that the paint was graphene coated in preparation for the sale. The Carfax report notes that the car was involved in a rear-end collision in 2013 and a single-vehicle collision in 2015. Close-up photos of the body panels, glass, and lenses can be viewed in the gallery.",

            "The heated power-adjustable front sport seats are upholstered in black Nappa leather, and interior amenities include automatic climate control, navigation, driver-seat position memory settings, and Harman Kardon audio. The Competition Package added Alcantara trim to the handbrake as well as Alu Tec aluminum trim to the dashboard and door panels.",
            "The steering wheel has been retrimmed in microsuede with M-color stitching, and instrumentation includes a 185-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a variable redline along with gauges for coolant temperature, oil temperature, and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 160k miles.",
            "The 3.0L Toyota 2JZ-GTE was installed using TireDeathRacing adapter mounts and a Wiring Specialties wiring harness. It has been fitted with a single BorgWarner turbocharger, exhaust headers, a RadiumAuto fuel rail, and a front-mount intercooler. The selling dealer reports that the fluids were changed in preparation for the sale.",
            "Originally an SMG model, the car was fitted with a BMW six-speed manual transmission using a PMC Motorsport Stage 1 adaptor and clutch kit as well as Condor Speed Shop transmission mounts. The BMW limited-slip differential remains in place, and a subframe reinforcement kit was reportedly installed in 2020. The selling dealer notes that the underside was dry-ice blasted in preparation for sale.",

The car was ordered without a sunroof and left the factory finished in Carbon Black Metallic over black leather and M Cloth upholstery. The 3.2-liter S54 inline-six has been modified with a Vortech V2-Ti supercharger from Race Marque Systems (RMS) as well as forged pistons, an ECS Tuning baffled oil catch can, and a Ron Davis radiator. Additional modifications include a CSL-style front bumper, a MagnaFlow exhaust system, 19\u2033 HRE wheels, Brembo disc brakes, KW Variant 3 coilovers, Turner Motorsport suspension components, a custom stereo system, and an ACT clutch and flywheel assembly for the six-speed manual transmission. The seller acquired the car on BaT in September 2020, and subsequent work has included installing a carbon-fiber front splitter and rear diffuser as well as replacing the water pump, alternator, and accessory belts. This modified E46 M3 coupe has 38k miles and is now offered with manufacturer\u2019s literature, a window sticker, and a clean Arizona title in the name of the seller\u2019s LLC.",

The seller notes that the CSL-style front bumper was damaged, repaired, and repainted in 2021. Additional work performed under current ownership has included rolling the front fenders as well as installing a carbon-fiber front splitter and rear diffuser. There is a scratch on the right-front corner of the hood, a ding on the left quarter panel, wear on the spoiler, and broken gasket material around the rear quarter windows.",
            "Polished 19\u2033 HRE 540 Series wheels are mounted with 245/35 front and 285/30 rear Michelin Pilot Super Sport tires.

Work under current ownership is said to have included replacing the water pump, alternator, battery, accessory belts, and oil level sensor and dipstick o-rings along with the intercooler inlet hose and supercharger oil drain hose. An oil change was carried out in January 2023.",

Additional equipment includes 18\u2033 M double-spoke wheels, a Harman Kardon sound system, aluminum pedal covers, a BMW Business CD stereo, and manually adjustable front seats. Service under current ownership is said to have consisted of reupholstering the driver\u2019s seat, flushing the brake and power steering fluids, and replacing the A-pillar and cowl trim components, drive belts, and idler pulleys. This E46 M3 is now offered with partial service records, an accident-free Carfax report, and a clean Colorado title in the seller\u2019s name.",

            "This 2002 BMW M3 coupe was acquired by the seller approximately four years ago, and it was subsequently overhauled and modified. The 3.2-liter inline-six was rebuilt, the subframe was reinforced, the double-VANOS system was fitted with Beisan Systems components, and a Diffsonline limited-slip differential with a 3.85:1 gear ratio was installed. Additional modifications include a color-changing vinyl wrap, a Rogue Engineering Stage 2 clutch kit, Supersprint headers, a Rogue Engineering Diablo exhaust system, MCS two-way adjustable coilover suspension, StopTech big-brake kits front and rear, a carbon-fiber sunroof plug and interior door panels, a yellow roll bar, Sabelt Titan fixed-back bucket seats, Schroth harnesses, CD stereo with navigation, and 18\u201d Bimmerworld TE:AL wheels. This modified E46 M3 coupe is now offered in New York with service records, an accident-free Carfax report, and a clean New Jersey title in the seller\u2019s name.",
            "The car was ordered in Steel Gray Metallic, and the bodywork has been covered in a color-changing 3M Flip Deep Space wrap. Exterior features include a carbon-fiber sunroof plug, fog lights, front fender vents, a single exhaust outlet, and xenon headlights with replacement covers. The front bumper cover has been replaced, and various bubbles and scratches in the vinyl wrap are noted along with dents on the right door that can be seen up close in the gallery below.",
            "The 18\u201d Bimmerworld TE:AL wheels are secured on Rogue Engineering studs and mounted with Bridgestone Potenza RE-71R tires. Braking is through yellow-finished StopTech monoblock calipers equipped with PFC 11 pads, and slotted rotors are fitted at all four corners. The front control arm bushings and rear trailing arm bushings have reportedly been replaced, and suspension modifications include MCS two-way adjustable coilovers, Vorshlag front camber plates, Rogue Engineering strut tower braces, adjustable rear control arms, and a subframe reinforcement kit. Two spare wheels and tires will accompany the vehicle.",
            "The seller states that the sound deadening was removed before fitting twin Sabelt Titan fixed-back bucket seats with Schroth multi-point harnesses. Additional equipment includes carbon-fiber door panels, fabric door pulls, a powder-coated yellow roll bar, a Rogue Engineering short-shift kit, and an aftermarket touchscreen CD stereo with navigation. The rear seats have been removed and are not included in the sale.",
            "The OMP steering wheel with yellow stitching sits ahead of a 185-mph speedometer, a tachometer with a variable redline, and gauges for coolant temperature, oil temperature, and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates approximately 141k miles, around 2k of which have been added during current ownership. The mileage tamper dot is illuminated, and total mileage is unknown.",
            "The 3.2-liter S54 inline-six was rebuilt during current ownership. Additional work included fitting the double-VANOS system with Beisan Systems components, installing an ECIS intake, an aluminum radiator, Supersprint headers, a Rogue Engineering Diablo exhaust system, and Moroso aluminum coolant tank, and replacing the water pump, fuel filter, oil cooler, and connecting rod bearings.",
            "Power is sent to the rear wheels via a six-speed manual transmission with a Rogue Engineering Stage 2 performance clutch kit and a Diffsonline limited-slip differential with a 3.85:1 gear ratio and replacement bearings. Additional underbody images are provided in the gallery below.",
            "The Carfax report shows no accidents or other damage, lists an open recall for the passenger-side front airbag in 2020, and displays history in Texas, North Carolina, South Carolina, New York, and New Jersey through the most recent entry in December 2020."

            "This 2005 BMW M3 coupe is finished in Silver Grey Metallic over M Texture Alcantara and black leather upholstery, and it is powered by a 3.2-liter inline-six paired with a six-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential. Factory equipment includes the Competition Package, xenon headlights, automatic climate control, and a factory Hi-Fi sound system with a CD player, while modifications are said to include a carbon-fiber front lip spoiler, Eibach springs, underdrive pulleys, a K&N cold-air intake, CSL-specification exhaust headers, and aftermarket engine-management software. The car was first registered in Wyoming and was moved to Utah when it was acquired in 2010 by the seller, who has added approximately 27k of its 33k indicated miles. Service since 2018 has included a valve adjustment and replacement of the tires, spark plugs, valve-cover gasket, clutch components, and an ignition coil. This E46 M3 is now offered with a window sticker, manufacturer\u2019s literature, service records, spare parts, an accident-free Carfax report, and a clean Utah title in the seller\u2019s name.",
            "The car is finished in Silver Grey Metallic (A08) and was built without a sunroof. Features include a carbon-fiber front lip spoiler, xenon headlights, body-color front corner markers, Shadowline trim, fog lights, rain-sensing windshield wipers, tinted windows, LED taillights, a trunk-lid spoiler, \u201cCS\u201d rear badging, and quad exhaust outlets. Paint-meter readings can be viewed in the photo gallery below.",
            "Factory 19\u2033 M cross-spoke wheels are wrapped in 235/35 front and 265/30 rear Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires that were mounted in May 2021. The car is equipped with Dynamic Stability Control (DSC), and the Competition Package added an upgraded steering rack and larger cross-drilled brake rotors when compared with the standard M3. Eibach Pro-Kit springs were installed in 2007.",
            "The cabin features seating surfaces trimmed in M Texture Alcantara with black leather accents. Equipment includes manually adjustable front sport seats, a shorter center console without a front armrest, LED interior lighting, aluminum pedals, an Alcantara shifter boot, automatic climate control, and a Hi-Fi sound system with a BMW Business CD stereo.",
            "The Alcantara-wrapped sport steering wheel features a yellow centering stripe and fronts a 185-mph speedometer, a tachometer with a variable redline, and gauges for coolant temperature, oil temperature, and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates approximately 33k miles, nearly 27k of which were added by the seller.",
            "The 3.2-liter S54 inline-six is said to have been fitted with underdrive pulleys, a K&N cold-air intake, aftermarket engine-management software, and CSL-specification exhaust headers with welded post-catalyst oxygen-sensor bungs. Work since 2018 reportedly has included a valve adjustment, oil changes, and replacement of the valve-cover gasket, spark plugs, and the cylinder-four ignition coil.",
            "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual transmission and an M Variable Lock differential. The clutch delay valve has been removed, the factory clutch and flywheel were reinstalled in 2018, and the left rear axle seal was replaced in 2021.",
            "The car is supplied with manufacturer\u2019s literature, service records from current and prior ownership, aftermarket parts literature, a tool kit, a car cover, and removed spare parts as shown in the gallery.",
            "The Carfax report shows no accidents or other damage and lists history in Wyoming and Utah. The lien noted on the report was paid off in 2017."
