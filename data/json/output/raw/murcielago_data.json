            "This 2008 Lamborghini Murci\u00e9lago LP640 coupe is said to have been exhibited by Lamborghini to showcase their Ad Personam program, and it also participated at the Concorso Italiano event during Monterey Car Week in 2017 and 2018, where it was awarded second and first place, respectively. The car is believed to be the only coupe finished in Blu Cepheus, and it has 17k miles through the seller\u2019s purchase in 2016. Powered by a 6.5-liter V12 that drives all four wheels through an E-gear six-speed automated transmission, the car is equipped with Marrone Janus upholstery with Q-Citura quilted inserts, a GMG exhaust system, a Kenwood stereo, a limited-slip rear differential, black 18\u2033 Hemera alloy wheels, carbon-fiber interior and engine bay trim, carbon-ceramic brakes, a front-axle lift system, a speed-activated rear spoiler, a carbon-fiber-trimmed steering wheel, automatically deploying rear intakes, a rearview camera, and automatic climate control. This Murci\u00e9lago LP640 coupe is now offered with the owner\u2019s manual, service records, a car cover, a Carfax report, and a California title.",
            "The Murci\u00e9lago was designed by Luc Donckerwolke and was publicly unveiled in 2001 at the Frankfurt Motor Show as the replacement for the Diablo. According to the seller, this example is the only coupe finished in Blu Cepheus. Exterior details include a speed-activated rear spoiler, a pantograph windshield wiper, xenon headlights, scissor doors, rear fog lights, a hexagonal exhaust outlet, and automatically deploying rear intakes to aid in cooling. Damage to the front is listed in a November 2015 entry of the Carfax report. The car received paintwork in 2016 and 2019, and the front bumper cover and rocker panels were also refinished in 2025. Paint protection film has been applied to the front bumper cover, hood, and lower rocker panels, per the seller, who notes paint chips on the rocker panels.",
            "The 18\u2033 Hemera alloy wheels were refinished in May 2025, at which time they were mounted with Pirelli P Zero tires. The TPMS sensors and front wheel bearings were replaced, and the brake fluid was also flushed at that time. Stopping power is provided by black-finished calipers fitted over cross-drilled ceramic-composite rotors at each corner, and the car is equipped with active dampers and a front-axle lift system.",
            "The cabin houses manually adjustable seats trimmed in Marrone Janus upholstery\u00a0with Q-Citura quilted inserts, and appointments include carbon-fiber trim, carpeted floor mats, a rearview camera, automatic climate control, inboard shoulder restraints, a JL Audio amplifier, and a Kenwood stereo.",
            "The carbon-fiber-trimmed steering wheel features carbon-fiber paddle shifters and frames a 220-mph speedometer and a 9k-rpm tachometer as well as auxiliary gauges for fuel level, coolant temperature, oil pressure, and oil temperature. The digital odometer indicates 17k miles, approximately 7k of which were added under current ownership.",
            "The carbon-fiber-trimmed engine bay houses the mid-mounted 6.5-liter V12, which was factory rated at 632 horsepower and 487 lb-ft of torque. Work in May 2025 included adjusting the valves, rebuilding the starter, changing the oil, and replacing the battery, drive belt, air filters, spark plugs, engine mounts, lower intake manifold gasket, and valve cover gaskets. The car passed an emissions inspection in November 2025.",
            "A Valentino Balboni signature adorns the carbon-fiber engine bay trim.",
            "Power is routed to all four wheels via an E-gear six-speed automated transmission and a limited-slip rear differential. The transmission fluid was replaced in May 2025, and the car is equipped with a GMG exhaust system.",
            "See the full CARFAX Report for additional information",
            "The Carfax report shows the aforementioned damage.",
            "There is currently a lien out on the car, and the seller\u2019s lender will need to be paid off before the title can be transferred to the new owner."
