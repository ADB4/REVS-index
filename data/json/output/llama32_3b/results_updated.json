      "This 2002 BMW M3 convertible is a nicely optioned example with just under 100k from new and a clean Carfax report. The drivetrain is stock with a number of recent service items addressed and no deferred maintenance. Blue Topaz Metallic paint over gray leather has been nicely maintained, and the car benefits from new brakes, new engine belts, and more detailed below. The seller says this does not look like a 13-year-old BMW, and the photo gallery below showcases the condition well. It is factory equipped with a 6-speed manual, cold weather package, bi-xenon headlights, and Harmon Kardon sound. Good colors, manual gearbox, and recent maintenance make this an attractive E46 M3.",
      "Topaz Blue paint is an attractive color and the body is all original and in excellent condition. The seller says there are not dents and minimal dings, mostly small paint chips as expected on the front spoiler.  The black canvas roof still looks new and the previous owner installed CSL carbon fiber front splitters. Stock 18\u2033 wheels are uncurbed with a clean factory finish and the rears wear new Bridgestone Potenza tires. Headlamp lenses are clear with no clouding.",
      "Dove grey leather is surprisingly clean for the mileage considering that this lighter interior tends to discolor with age. The seats have no tears tight bolsters. The original carpets, dashboard, and trim are in very good condition, and the optional cold weather package with heated seats is nice to have with the top down. Factory accessory M3 floor mats are a fine addition, and sale includes one original key and a newly programmed key from the dealer.",
      "Underhood, the S54 3.2L straight six is unmodified apart from a K&N intake and looks very clean. This is a fantastic powertrain with 333 horsepower and an 8,000 rpm redline. The car has recently benefitted from new brakes, new idle control valve, new belts, and new battery, and the car was serviced last year with full synthetic oil. The onboard computer says the next oil change is due in 10k miles.",
      "The car was purchased out of South Carolina and has been with the seller in Ohio for two years, always garaged in the winter months. The E46 M3 design has aged well and this car appears well preserved for a weekend or daily driver. Prior to the sellers\u2019 purchase he obtained a Carfax and PPI which are both viewable below."

The 3.2 liter inline six is said to run strong and has recently received a $3k-service which entailed a newly rebuilt Vanos system as well as new fluids. The car appears clean overall and records from the original BMW dealer in CA show regular service intervals every 7k-10k miles. The seller has provided a recent PPI and the car carries a clean Carfax, clean Autocheck, and clean California title.",
      "Original paint presents well and appears glossy, though the seller reports some crazing on the right side of the rear bumper. The clear coat is starting to peel on the driver\u2019s side roof molding. Exterior rubber appears to be in good condition, aside from passenger side rear window trim, which shows some cracking from UV damage.",
      "The body is appears straight, and no history of accidents or repair work are noted in the provided Carfax. The rear subframe has been inspected by Redline BMW and it is crack-free. There is a small indentation on the lower right of the front bumper. The chrome grille surround and black trim appear to be in good shape.",
      "Stock 19\u2033 alloys are in good condition, with some minor curb rash evident on three of the wheels. The seller notes that although the front tires have a decent amount of tread left, the back tires will need replacement soon.",
      "The interior remains stock and retains its original stereo system. The seller says the brake pad light is on, but all other gauges, lights, and power accessories are functioning properly.",
      "The Imola Red leather upholstery looks great with contrasting black and aluminum trim. The seats are in good condition and show normal wear on the side bolsters. The carpets and floormats look clean, and rear seats appear hardly used.",
      "The 3.2 liter S54 is matched to a 6-speed Getrag transmission, with output numbers advertised at 333 bhp and 262 lb\u00b7ft when new.",
      "The car was purchased in California by the seller and was brought to Fort Lauderdale, FL in April. After arrival it received a PPI and a $3,000 service by Redline BMW in Pompano Beach, FL. The Vanos variable valve timing system was completely rebuilt with Beisan systems components, and the engine, transmission, and differential fluids were flushed and replenished.",
      "The original tool kit is complete with a bumper tow hook not pictured above. The seller has the receipts for the recent service, as well as records from the BMW dealership in CA that show service intervals every 7-10,000 miles.",

The 3.2L S54 inline-six is paired with a 6-speed Sequential Manual Gearbox (SMG) and is equipped with a VF570 Supercharger Kit. This E46 coupe was well optioned from the factory, and the seller reports $28k in upgrades have been installed over the last 8 years, including a CSL diffuser, Angel Eyes headlights, Borla exhaust, adjustable Koni shocks, upgraded sound, and 18\u2033 wheels with performance tires. This M3 has been with the seller for 2 years and 6k miles, and is described as garage-kept with no mechanical issues. The car is offered with extensive service records, a clean Carfax, and clean Pennsylvania title.",
      "The Titan Silver Metallic (354) paint shows well, with no obvious dings or dents even to the exposed CSL Carbon Fiber diffuser and Predator Chromium CCFL Angel Eyes headlights. Body panels appear straight, and shut lines are tight.",
      "The front bumper was replaced and the front end repainted in 2008 to remedy the results of a gravel spray experienced by a prior owner.",
      "The Jet Black interior (N5SW) surfaces show well, without significant visible marks or cracks. The seats show light wear to side bolsters, typical creasing, and some dimpling to seating surfaces. Interior upgrades include a Kleinn Model HK1 air horn, LeatherZ Alacantra shift and e-brake boots, and a ZHP weighted short-shift knob with BMW M logo fitted to the SMG selector.",
      "Factory options include the Cold Weather package and power moonroof. The seller reports all lighting, controls, and accessories are functioning as intended, while sound has been uprated with JL Audio 8\u2033 Sub Stealth Boxes and a DICE MediaBridge with Bluetooth, smartphone, USB, and satellite radio connectivity.",

      "Stock wheels were replaced in 2013 with Apex ARC-8 Hypersilver 18\u00d79.5\u2033 items using an APEX 75mm stud conversion kit. The wheels remain clean and unmarked, and wear Michelin Pilot Super Sport tires also added in 2013. The seller reports services in 2016 included a brake fluid flush and replacement of rotors/pads all around.",
      "The 3.2L S54 inline-six has been fitted with a VF570 Supercharger as seen above. The seller reports power measurements taken using a VBOX showed a 9.09 second 60-130 mph time, which is reportedly 4 seconds faster than a stock M3 Coupe. Other modifications include a HFP 255LPH fuel pump and an Elite Engineering oil catch can. In 2015, the stock connecting rod bearings were replaced with a WPC-treated items and ARP rod bolts were added. A new oil pump, motor mounts, and O2 sensors are installed at the same time. This M3 is described as having no current mechanical issues, and 2016 work included replacement of the oil level and pressure sensors, transmission/differential fluid changes, and an engine oil/filer change. The battery was replaced in 2013.",
      "In 2008 this M3 suffered a cracked rear sub-frame, which was replaced under warranty by BMW NA. Repairs included replacement of the entire rear-end with an upgraded/reinforced sub-frame at a cost of ~$12k. This work is documented in a 10-page service report shown in the photo gallery below.

The car is finished in Interlagos Blue over a black leather interior and was acquired by the seller more than two years ago. The 3.2L S54 inline-six is stock, though the car has been modified with a carbon fiber intake, short shift kit, Ground Control/Koni coilovers, and an aftermarket stereo with navigation. Within the past 5k miles, the car received a full preventative cooling system overhaul and Inspection 2, which included fresh oil, filters, spark plugs, valve adjustment, valve cover gasket, rear differential oil, and gearbox oil, in addition to standard service safety checks. It is sold with a clean Autocheck report and a clear Oregon title in the seller\u2019s name.",
      "The desirable M3 Competition package was a $4,000 option offering both performance and cosmetic upgrades from the standard M3, including 19\u2033 BBS spin-cast alloy wheels, CSL Steering rack featuring a more direct steering ratio, upgraded brakes with painted black calipers, as well as the exclusive color option of Interlagos blue.",
      "The finish appears deep and glossy in photographs with the exception of the front air dam, which received a poor quality repaint from a previous owner. The seller suspects this to be the only non-original on the vehicle, and has also included photos of numerous rock chips, paint peel at the headlight, and lower edge damage. The remainder of the paint and bodywork present well, and panels are believed factory. Minor cosmetic scratches and chips are limited to the back bumper, trunk, rear passenger quarter panel, and hood.",
      "Upgraded OEM 19\u2033 BBS wheels were powder coated in anthracite gray by a previous owner and wear Michelin Pilot Super Sports. Included with the car is an extra set of Apex Arc-8 18\u2033 x 10\u2033 wheels and Dunlop Direzza Z2 tires that have seen three track days.",
      "The interior appears well kept and features Comp Pack upgrades including an Alcantara steering wheel cover with colored stitching and aluminum trim. Upholstery, headliner, and carpets show minimal wear for mileage, and both seats are fully functional with minor scratches and fading on their bolsters. The seller notes that there is an area of minor denting on the aluminum trim above the glove box.",
      "All instruments, gauges, lights, and power accessories are said to function as intended, and the air conditioning reportedly blows cold. A Dynanav stereo/navigation system was installed by the previous owner with steering wheel controls integrated for hands free operation. The Competition Package \u201cM-Track\u201d mode is still operational via windshield wiper stalk end button. All factory trim steering wheel pieces are included to return the steering to factory setup.",
      "The 3.2L S54 is paired to a 6-speed Getrag transmission and was advertised as making of 333 horsepower and 262 lb. ft. of torque when new. A Gruppe M Carbon Fiber Intake and short shift kit from ECS tuning have been added. The steering, brakes, engine, clutch, and transmission are all said to be functioning well.",
      "Other performance upgrades include Ground Control/Koni coilover suspension with camber plates and SS DOT brake lines. The wheel wells and undercarriage look to be in good condition and photos can be seen in the gallery. The seller states that there is no rust and that the rear subframe has been inspected for weak points.",
      "Records are limited from previous owners, though the seller maintains a detailed service folder. The Autocheck report shows no accidents, and all airbag recalls have been completed. Over 120 detailed photos are viewable below."

The original owner was in the military, and as such the car spent quite a lot of time in storage, contributing to the low mileage. This unmodified example has been with the seller for six years and around 22k miles. It is sold with service records back to new, original window sticker, car cover, a clean Carfax, and clean California title in the seller\u2019s name.",

The factory staggered-width 18\u2033 wheels are fitted with Bridgestone S-04 Pole Position tires mounted in October of last year. The original owner had the door seals replaced in 2006 and a 1/2\u2033 crack is present in the windshield near the wipers, though per the seller it has not worsened in more than a year.",
      "The unmodified interior is optioned with Black Leather, Glass Moonroof, Power front Seats, and a Harman-Kardan Sound System with AUX input. All of the interior features work as they should, including the automatic climate control and cold A/C.",
      "Light wear is present on the leather upholstery, primarily on the driver\u2019s seat. The rear seat and carpets appear to be have held up quite well.",
      "The 3.2 liter inline-six produced 333 horsepower when new and features individual throttle bodies. The hose from the SMG reservoir to the pump was replaced in 2013, and the SMG controller was reprogrammed in 2004 as part of a recall. The service record indicates that both owners changed the oil more regularly than BMW\u2019s recommended 15k mile interval.",
      "Service records are included back to new and the seller has attached a useful summary of the services that can be viewed in the gallery. The original books, manuals, and a BMW car cover are all included, and the window sticker shows a total suggested retail price of $56,190.",
      "The Carfax shows no accidents or reports of damage, though a pair of open recalls are noted for the airbags. The seller\u2019s local dealer is currently out of the parts to deal with the recall, though he is in line for a new shipment in the new year."

      "This 2001 BMW M3 has 67k miles and is an unmodified example finished in Laguna Seca Blue. The car is powered by a 3.2 liter S54 inline-six paired to a 6-speed manual transmission and is optioned with Cold Weather and Luxury Packages. Sold new in Houston, the car saw 14 years of single-owner service before moving to New England, where it was purchased by its third owner after this BaT auction in 2015. It has been driven approximately 14k miles in the ensuing 14 months and a comprehensive inspection and service were commissioned in May 2016 with the results included below. Dealer service receipts indicate regular maintenance as well as completion of recalls for rod bearings and Takata airbags, and the sale includes a clean Carfax and a clear Rhode Island title.",
      "Laguna Seca Blue paint retains an even gloss with occasional light swirls, and few finish flaws are visible in photos aside from occasional stone chips in the nose and a small dent near the driver\u2019s door handle as detailed in the gallery below. Remaining garaged since arriving in New England in 2015, the car has reportedly never seen snow or salt and is said to be free of exterior rust. Factory 18\u2033 satin chrome wheels show varying levels of curb rash and wear Toyo Proxes rubber installed at 56k miles with plenty of remaining tread.",
      "Plastic cladding looks free of distortion, though a small area of touched-up cracking is visible on the rear bumper cover along with scuffs on the underside of the front valance. Optional xenon headlights are equipped with washers and show minimal haze or pitting, and both fog lights were replaced in 2015 but are missing their plastic trim rings. Heated mirrors, washer jets, and door locks are standard items, while an optional glass moonroof and rain-sensing wipers are part of the Luxury Package. All accessories were verified in good condition during the 2016 inspection.",
      "Powered heated Nappa leather front seats feature adjustable-width backrests with wear limited to the bolsters on the driver\u2019s side. Carpets look plush and largely clean under protective mats. Both door panels are free of deformation and the textured dash looks straight and clean, while other plastics show areas of marking and typical fabric separation is present on several pillar trims. The multi-function thumbgrip wheel shows little evidence of use, though peeling is visible on the shift knob.",
      "Switchgear is brightly lettered, while instrumentation includes an odometer showing just under 67k miles and digital displays look free of dead pixels. An optional Harman Kardon sound system includes a six-CD changer and all interior functions were noted as working during the 2016 inspection. Several diagnostic trouble codes were also noted and cleared as described in the invoice below. Common gel failure is visible in the auto-darkening rearview mirror though it does not leak, and the oil level light occasionally illuminates despite being full.",
      "Power is from a stock 3.2 liter S54 straight six with Double VANOS valve timing that was good for 333 horsepower when new. A comprehensive inspection was performed 10k miles ago in May 2016 by Hans Imports of Rhode Island and included in-depth assessment of the drivetrain, braking, and suspension systems as noted in the gallery below. Oil passage expansion plugs were also replaced to alleviate a leak, and a synthetic oil change was performed along with installation of a new air filter and cleaning of the engine bay. A new water pump was installed in 2015 and spark plugs, fuel filter and PCV are due soon according to the inspection report.",
      "The 6-speed manual transmission feeds power rearward to a variable locking differential, and dynamic brake and stability control are also equipped. An earlier inspection noted none of the rear subframe issues common to the model and the underside looks free of notable damage in photos, while superficial corrosion appears limited to the stock exhaust system. Slight residual seepage is described from the transmission bell housing.",
      "Dealer service history is included from new and shows that a rod bearing recall was performed in October of 2004 along with a Takata airbag recall in September 2015. The car also comes with a detailed report from the 2016 inspection as well as original manuals and keys, six quarts of Castrol synthetic oil, and an original window sticker showing a total MSRP of just under $53k."

      "This 2002 BMW M3 has just over 24k miles and is an unmodified California car powered by a 3.2 liter S54 inline-six paired to a 6-speed manual transmission. Finished in silver over black, this example was recently acquired by the seller from the original owner. It has been used as an occasional driver throughout its life and has reportedly benefited from regular dealer maintenance as well as completed recalls for engine bearings and its passenger-side Takata airbag. A dealer-performed Inspection II was performed in August 2016, and the car is sold with a clean Carfax report along with a clear California title in the seller\u2019s name.",
      "Titan Silver paint retains a smooth gloss with few finish flaws visible in photos aside from occasional light marks, scuffs on the lower front valance, and road grime aft of the rear wheel wells. Sheet metal looks straight other than a small ding in the roof pictured in the gallery below. Crisp lines and even panel gaps are on display throughout, and no accidents are indicated in the Carfax report.",
      "Plastic cladding looks free of cracks or distortion. Some curbing is visible on each of the factory 18\u2033 wheels along with light oxidation of their satin chrome finish. Bridgestone RE760 Sport rubber is from 2010 and shows a decent amount of tread remaining. Lighting is shown to be working in photos and lenses appear free of haze or cracks throughout, including over the bi-xenon headlamps.",
      "Interior wear appears minimal, with leather surfaces showing occasional marks as well as light abrasion and wrinkling on the driver\u2019s bolsters. Carpets look plush and clean where visible beneath new OEM floor mats. Both door panels are deformation and the textured dash looks straight and clean. The multi-function thumbgrip wheel shows little evidence of use aside from a light shine around its rim, though some bubbling is noted on the the driver\u2019s door pull.",
      "Instrumentation remains clear and digital displays look free of dead pixels. The car was ordered with optional navigation and all switchgear retains bright lettering and functional backlighting. A replacement is included for the auto-dimming mirror, which exhibits typical failure and has leaked onto the ashtray cover below. The driver\u2019s seat belt retraction is said to be sluggish but operational.",
      "The stock 3.2 liter S54 inline-six features Double VANOS valve timing and produced 333 horsepower when new. The 6-speed manual transmission sends power to the rear wheels through a variable locking differential. The absence of a factory strut tower brace identifies the car as an early 2002 example.",
      "Warranty records are included in the gallery and show that recalls were carried out to replace the enigne\u2019s big-end bearings in 2003 and install revised bearing shells in 2005. The car has exhibited no symptoms of bearing-related trouble according to the seller. An additional completed recall is shown for the passenger-side Takata airbag, while a dealer-performed Inspection II in August 2016 revealed none of the rear subframe issues common to the model.",
      "The clean Carfax chronicles dealer visits through 2013, while two additional services were reportedly completed in 2014 and 2016 but are missing from the report. The car passed a California emissions test in December 2016 and is ready for transfer to its new owner. The seller has put 500 miles on the car and is selling to focus on a track-prepped version."

      "This 2002 BMW M3 Coupe is finished in Titanium Silver over Imola Red leather and has been modified with a 9psi supercharger, water/methanol injection, coilover suspension, performance exhaust, CSL body pieces, and more. The seller is an active BMW forum participant who purchased the car stock with 116k miles in 2013, and personally performed the mechanical modifications as well as adding ARC-8 wheels and a host of other cosmetic touches over the last four years. The car\u2019s S54 3.2-liter inline six and SMG automated manual gearbox remain internally stock and it has now traveled 137k miles. Described as fast and meticulously cared for, it is sold with an Autocheck report detailed below as well as a clean Pennsylvania title in the seller\u2019s name.",
      "An OEM M3 CSL trunk lid was imported from France and installed along with new side skirts and a dual-hole CSL-style front bumper cover with a carbon fiber lip. All were painted in Titanium Silver along with both rear quarter panels and the rear bumper cover, while the finish remains original from the doors forward and retains a high gloss thanks to covered storage out of the Pennsylvania weather. Signs of use up front appear limited to a handful of chips and occasional road marks commensurate with mileage.",
      "Panel gaps look consistent and two accidents indicated by the included Autocheck are noted as minor, although the report omits further details. Weighing in at 18 pounds apiece, anthracite Apex ARC-8 wheels are mounted with a 90mm stud conversion kit and 15mm rear spacers. All four are a \u201csquare\u201d 18\u00d79.5\u2033 rather than the factory staggered sizes to allow for easy rotation of their two-year-old Michelin Pilot Super Sport rubber, which shows plenty of tread remaining according to the seller.",
      "\u201cShadow\u201d window trim is joined by kidneys, grilles and sideview mirrors which have all been repainted in gloss black. Smoked corner markers complement a new set of retrofitted later-model factory LED taillights, xenon headlights with washers and new lenses, new side markers, and E92 LED license plate lights. The windshield cowl and lower rear window gasket have been replaced by the seller.",
      "A similar level of effort has gone into interior cosmetics and includes swapping a low-mileage Imola Red interior in place of the original gray seats and door panels, which are also included in the sale. Leather surfaces show occasional superficial cracks but minimal wrinkling or wear are evident even on driver\u2019s side bolsters. Matching door and rear side panels are free from deformation and show only light signs of use, while common pillar trim separation has been addressed with new covers. Carpets look devoid of major wear where visible in photos.",
      "The textured dash is clean and new Titanium Shadow trim has been installed throughout, while other plastics look devoid of cracks or excessive marking. A ZHP shift knob has been fitted, switchgear retains bright lettering, and the multi-function sport steering wheel rim shows some wear around the rim. The stereo is an updated factory unit from a later car and features an OEM auxiliary input. An armrest delete console features a roll-top \u201cEuro tray\u201d rather than the twin cupholders found in US-market cars, and the car is further optioned with heated seats, a sunroof and Park Distance Control.",
      "Modifications underhood consist of a Prima Plus supercharger kit from Active Autowerke which provides 9 psi of boost to the 3.2-liter inline six. The centrifugal supercharger is supplemented with a trunk-mounted water/methanol injection system along with a tune from Tuning Tech FS, a combination which is claimed by Active Autowerke to make over 500 horsepower at the rear wheels on 93-octane pump fuel.",
      "Shifting is from a stock SMG automated manual gearbox, and the seller suggests that while the clutch does not require immediate attention, it can be expected to have a shorter than typical life due to the forced-induction power. Exhaust is via catless black ceramic-coated headers, a resonated X-pipe, SCZA muffler and stainless tips from Status Gruppe. All combine for an aggressive sound without the rasp typical to other aftermarket E46 M3 systems according to the seller.",
      "Adjustable SRS coilovers from Status Gruppe are mounted with camber plates and use 700kg race springs up with 800kg units in the rear. The seller has driven the car a bit over 5k miles per year during his ownership, stating that it starts quickly whether hot or cold and drives well with the modifications. All modification work was performed personally by the seller, who notes approximately $20k in spending on modification parts alone since April 2013.",
      "Two accidents are reported on the included Autocheck, which also indicates an outstanding Takata airbag recall. An Inspection II was reportedly completed at 124k miles and the most recent oil change was performed at 133k miles, with the seller further noting that only Shell or Sunoco 93-octane fuel and Castrol 10W-60 oil have been used during his ownership. The fixed-back driver\u2019s seat visible in some photos has been removed, but original parts and spares include the full OEM gray interior and 18\u2033 wheels along with an extra set of 12mm wheel spacers."

      "This 2006 BMW M3 Convertible has 59k miles and is finished in Carbon Black Metallic over Black leather. The car had an MSRP of $62,995 and is optioned with the Cold Weather Package including heated seats, parking back-up sensors, Xenon Headlights, Harmon Kardon stereo, and 19\u2033 wheels. The 3.2 liter S54 inline-six is paired to a 6-speed manual and received a top-end rebuild by BMW in 2011 at 30k miles following damage to the valve train. The seller acquired the car over six years ago and reports that it has never been tracked. Modifications include Active Autowerke custom stainless headers and pipes, AFE intake, Dinan muffler, and an integrated Passport radar detector. A front-end alignment and oil/filer change were completed in November 2016 and the car is said to be running well with no current mechanical needs. This M3 is offered with service records covering the seller\u2019s ownership, an accident-free Carfax, original window sticker, manuals, BMW portfolio, and a clean Texas title in the seller\u2019s name.",
      "Carbon Black Metallic (416) is described as appearing black or very dark blue depending on light conditions. The finish has good shine throughout, and the seller indicates most of the paint is original. In anticipation of the sale, the rear bumper was repainted to address scuffs, and scratches were touched-up in several places on the passenger-side and around the driver-side front wheel. A passenger-side door ding was also professionally repaired and painted in 2014. A paint chip on the edge of the trunk lid above the M3 badge is shown in the gallery below.",
      "The optional 19\u2033 alloys show light curb marks to three wheels and heavier rash on the passenger-side rear item. Vredestein Ultrac Sessanta high performance rubber is fitted all around, with 50% tread life said to remain. A custom padded car cover is included with the sale and pictured in the gallery bellow.",
      "The Black leather (N5SW) interior is in good overall condition, with light creasing but no rips or tears. The driver\u2019s seat shows wear to the left bolster. Hard surfaces appear solid, with no cracks, chips, or missing pieces. Dark carpets appear solid and the driver\u2019s floor mat has worn through in the padded heel area.",
      "A Passport radar detector/laser deflector has been installed, with controls built into the cubby originally housing the ashtray. All four individual window switches function properly. The seller notes an intermittent issue with the switch to operate all windows simultaneously, where all four will lower together but only the rear windows raise up together.",
      "The 3.2 liter S54 inline-six has double-VANOS valve timing and delivered 333 horsepower when new in US-spec. Modifications include a cold air intake from Advanced Flow Engineering and an Active Autowerke performance chip. The seller reports a top-end engine rebuild by BMW at 30k miles, after broken bolts from the Vanos adjustment unit to the intake camshaft caused one broken rocker arm and bent intake valves. An October 2011 service report and a February 2017 summary from BMW are pictured in the gallery and describe the rebuild, which included:",
      "Custom stainless headers and pipes from Active Autowerke were added about 2,700 miles ago and are pictured here next to the original parts. A Dinan muffler was also installed at the same time.",
      "Undercarriage photos show a clean and dry car, with no indications of damage or prior repairs. A sub-frame inspection and installation of new sub-frame mounts were completed March 2011 at a BMW dealership according to the seller. The car is equipped with a Getrag 420G 6-speed manual and is said to run and drive well. Stainless Goodridge brake lines were added less than 5k miles ago, and are reported to provide a firmer and more responsive brake pedal.",
      "The accident-free Carfax includes some gaps in vehicle history and supports the indicated mileage. The seller reports that the open recall item was an airbag part issue, with the service since completed and on record with BMW. The original window sticker can be seen in the gallery below.",
      "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0EOq75K23g",
      "The seller has add this video which features the engine revving through the Active Autowerke headers/pipes and Dinan muffler.",
      "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FJvWJupkdc",
      "A second video provides another capture of this M3\u2019s exhaust note."
