      "This 2002 BMW M3 convertible is a nicely optioned example with just under 100k from new and a clean Carfax report. The drivetrain is stock with a number of recent service items addressed and no deferred maintenance. Blue Topaz Metallic paint over gray leather has been nicely maintained, and the car benefits from new brakes, new engine belts, and more detailed below. The seller says this does not look like a 13-year-old BMW, and the photo gallery below showcases the condition well. It is factory equipped with a 6-speed manual, cold weather package, bi-xenon headlights, and Harmon Kardon sound. Good colors, manual gearbox, and recent maintenance make this an attractive E46 M3.",
      "Topaz Blue paint is an attractive color and the body is all original and in excellent condition. The seller says there are not dents and minimal dings, mostly small paint chips as expected on the front spoiler.  The black canvas roof still looks new and the previous owner installed CSL carbon fiber front splitters. Stock 18\u2033 wheels are uncurbed with a clean factory finish and the rears wear new Bridgestone Potenza tires. Headlamp lenses are clear with no clouding.",
      "Dove grey leather is surprisingly clean for the mileage considering that this lighter interior tends to discolor with age. The seats have no tears tight bolsters. The original carpets, dashboard, and trim are in very good condition, and the optional cold weather package with heated seats is nice to have with the top down. Factory accessory M3 floor mats are a fine addition, and sale includes one original key and a newly programmed key from the dealer.",
      "Underhood, the S54 3.2L straight six is unmodified apart from a K&N intake and looks very clean. This is a fantastic powertrain with 333 horsepower and an 8,000 rpm redline. The car has recently benefitted from new brakes, new idle control valve, new belts, and new battery, and the car was serviced last year with full synthetic oil. The onboard computer says the next oil change is due in 10k miles.",
      "The car was purchased out of South Carolina and has been with the seller in Ohio for two years, always garaged in the winter months. The E46 M3 design has aged well and this car appears well preserved for a weekend or daily driver. Prior to the sellers\u2019 purchase he obtained a Carfax and PPI which are both viewable below."

The 3.2 liter inline six is said to run strong and has recently received a $3k-service which entailed a newly rebuilt Vanos system as well as new fluids. The car appears clean overall and records from the original BMW dealer in CA show regular service intervals every 7k-10k miles. The seller has provided a recent PPI and the car carries a clean Carfax, clean Autocheck, and clean California title.",
      "Original paint presents well and appears glossy, though the seller reports some crazing on the right side of the rear bumper. The clear coat is starting to peel on the driver\u2019s side roof molding. Exterior rubber appears to be in good condition, aside from passenger side rear window trim, which shows some cracking from UV damage.",
      "The body is appears straight, and no history of accidents or repair work are noted in the provided Carfax. The rear subframe has been inspected by Redline BMW and it is crack-free. There is a small indentation on the lower right of the front bumper. The chrome grille surround and black trim appear to be in good shape.",
      "Stock 19\u2033 alloys are in good condition, with some minor curb rash evident on three of the wheels. The seller notes that although the front tires have a decent amount of tread left, the back tires will need replacement soon.",
      "The interior remains stock and retains its original stereo system. The seller says the brake pad light is on, but all other gauges, lights, and power accessories are functioning properly.",
      "The Imola Red leather upholstery looks great with contrasting black and aluminum trim. The seats are in good condition and show normal wear on the side bolsters. The carpets and floormats look clean, and rear seats appear hardly used.",
      "The 3.2 liter S54 is matched to a 6-speed Getrag transmission, with output numbers advertised at 333 bhp and 262 lb\u00b7ft when new.",
      "The car was purchased in California by the seller and was brought to Fort Lauderdale, FL in April. After arrival it received a PPI and a $3,000 service by Redline BMW in Pompano Beach, FL. The Vanos variable valve timing system was completely rebuilt with Beisan systems components, and the engine, transmission, and differential fluids were flushed and replenished.",
      "The original tool kit is complete with a bumper tow hook not pictured above. The seller has the receipts for the recent service, as well as records from the BMW dealership in CA that show service intervals every 7-10,000 miles.",

The 3.2L S54 inline-six is paired with a 6-speed Sequential Manual Gearbox (SMG) and is equipped with a VF570 Supercharger Kit. This E46 coupe was well optioned from the factory, and the seller reports $28k in upgrades have been installed over the last 8 years, including a CSL diffuser, Angel Eyes headlights, Borla exhaust, adjustable Koni shocks, upgraded sound, and 18\u2033 wheels with performance tires. This M3 has been with the seller for 2 years and 6k miles, and is described as garage-kept with no mechanical issues. The car is offered with extensive service records, a clean Carfax, and clean Pennsylvania title.",
      "The Titan Silver Metallic (354) paint shows well, with no obvious dings or dents even to the exposed CSL Carbon Fiber diffuser and Predator Chromium CCFL Angel Eyes headlights. Body panels appear straight, and shut lines are tight.",
      "The front bumper was replaced and the front end repainted in 2008 to remedy the results of a gravel spray experienced by a prior owner.",
      "The Jet Black interior (N5SW) surfaces show well, without significant visible marks or cracks. The seats show light wear to side bolsters, typical creasing, and some dimpling to seating surfaces. Interior upgrades include a Kleinn Model HK1 air horn, LeatherZ Alacantra shift and e-brake boots, and a ZHP weighted short-shift knob with BMW M logo fitted to the SMG selector.",
      "Factory options include the Cold Weather package and power moonroof. The seller reports all lighting, controls, and accessories are functioning as intended, while sound has been uprated with JL Audio 8\u2033 Sub Stealth Boxes and a DICE MediaBridge with Bluetooth, smartphone, USB, and satellite radio connectivity.",

      "Stock wheels were replaced in 2013 with Apex ARC-8 Hypersilver 18\u00d79.5\u2033 items using an APEX 75mm stud conversion kit. The wheels remain clean and unmarked, and wear Michelin Pilot Super Sport tires also added in 2013. The seller reports services in 2016 included a brake fluid flush and replacement of rotors/pads all around.",
      "The 3.2L S54 inline-six has been fitted with a VF570 Supercharger as seen above. The seller reports power measurements taken using a VBOX showed a 9.09 second 60-130 mph time, which is reportedly 4 seconds faster than a stock M3 Coupe. Other modifications include a HFP 255LPH fuel pump and an Elite Engineering oil catch can. In 2015, the stock connecting rod bearings were replaced with a WPC-treated items and ARP rod bolts were added. A new oil pump, motor mounts, and O2 sensors are installed at the same time. This M3 is described as having no current mechanical issues, and 2016 work included replacement of the oil level and pressure sensors, transmission/differential fluid changes, and an engine oil/filer change. The battery was replaced in 2013.",
      "In 2008 this M3 suffered a cracked rear sub-frame, which was replaced under warranty by BMW NA. Repairs included replacement of the entire rear-end with an upgraded/reinforced sub-frame at a cost of ~$12k. This work is documented in a 10-page service report shown in the photo gallery below.

The car is finished in Interlagos Blue over a black leather interior and was acquired by the seller more than two years ago. The 3.2L S54 inline-six is stock, though the car has been modified with a carbon fiber intake, short shift kit, Ground Control/Koni coilovers, and an aftermarket stereo with navigation. Within the past 5k miles, the car received a full preventative cooling system overhaul and Inspection 2, which included fresh oil, filters, spark plugs, valve adjustment, valve cover gasket, rear differential oil, and gearbox oil, in addition to standard service safety checks. It is sold with a clean Autocheck report and a clear Oregon title in the seller\u2019s name.",
      "The desirable M3 Competition package was a $4,000 option offering both performance and cosmetic upgrades from the standard M3, including 19\u2033 BBS spin-cast alloy wheels, CSL Steering rack featuring a more direct steering ratio, upgraded brakes with painted black calipers, as well as the exclusive color option of Interlagos blue.",
      "The finish appears deep and glossy in photographs with the exception of the front air dam, which received a poor quality repaint from a previous owner. The seller suspects this to be the only non-original on the vehicle, and has also included photos of numerous rock chips, paint peel at the headlight, and lower edge damage. The remainder of the paint and bodywork present well, and panels are believed factory. Minor cosmetic scratches and chips are limited to the back bumper, trunk, rear passenger quarter panel, and hood.",
      "Upgraded OEM 19\u2033 BBS wheels were powder coated in anthracite gray by a previous owner and wear Michelin Pilot Super Sports. Included with the car is an extra set of Apex Arc-8 18\u2033 x 10\u2033 wheels and Dunlop Direzza Z2 tires that have seen three track days.",
      "The interior appears well kept and features Comp Pack upgrades including an Alcantara steering wheel cover with colored stitching and aluminum trim. Upholstery, headliner, and carpets show minimal wear for mileage, and both seats are fully functional with minor scratches and fading on their bolsters. The seller notes that there is an area of minor denting on the aluminum trim above the glove box.",
      "All instruments, gauges, lights, and power accessories are said to function as intended, and the air conditioning reportedly blows cold. A Dynanav stereo/navigation system was installed by the previous owner with steering wheel controls integrated for hands free operation. The Competition Package \u201cM-Track\u201d mode is still operational via windshield wiper stalk end button. All factory trim steering wheel pieces are included to return the steering to factory setup.",
      "The 3.2L S54 is paired to a 6-speed Getrag transmission and was advertised as making of 333 horsepower and 262 lb. ft. of torque when new. A Gruppe M Carbon Fiber Intake and short shift kit from ECS tuning have been added. The steering, brakes, engine, clutch, and transmission are all said to be functioning well.",
      "Other performance upgrades include Ground Control/Koni coilover suspension with camber plates and SS DOT brake lines. The wheel wells and undercarriage look to be in good condition and photos can be seen in the gallery. The seller states that there is no rust and that the rear subframe has been inspected for weak points.",
      "Records are limited from previous owners, though the seller maintains a detailed service folder. The Autocheck report shows no accidents, and all airbag recalls have been completed. Over 120 detailed photos are viewable below."

The original owner was in the military, and as such the car spent quite a lot of time in storage, contributing to the low mileage. This unmodified example has been with the seller for six years and around 22k miles. It is sold with service records back to new, original window sticker, car cover, a clean Carfax, and clean California title in the seller\u2019s name.",

The factory staggered-width 18\u2033 wheels are fitted with Bridgestone S-04 Pole Position tires mounted in October of last year. The original owner had the door seals replaced in 2006 and a 1/2\u2033 crack is present in the windshield near the wipers, though per the seller it has not worsened in more than a year.",
      "The unmodified interior is optioned with Black Leather, Glass Moonroof, Power front Seats, and a Harman-Kardan Sound System with AUX input. All of the interior features work as they should, including the automatic climate control and cold A/C.",
      "Light wear is present on the leather upholstery, primarily on the driver\u2019s seat. The rear seat and carpets appear to be have held up quite well.",
      "The 3.2 liter inline-six produced 333 horsepower when new and features individual throttle bodies. The hose from the SMG reservoir to the pump was replaced in 2013, and the SMG controller was reprogrammed in 2004 as part of a recall. The service record indicates that both owners changed the oil more regularly than BMW\u2019s recommended 15k mile interval.",
      "Service records are included back to new and the seller has attached a useful summary of the services that can be viewed in the gallery. The original books, manuals, and a BMW car cover are all included, and the window sticker shows a total suggested retail price of $56,190.",
      "The Carfax shows no accidents or reports of damage, though a pair of open recalls are noted for the airbags. The seller\u2019s local dealer is currently out of the parts to deal with the recall, though he is in line for a new shipment in the new year."

      "This 2001 BMW M3 has 67k miles and is an unmodified example finished in Laguna Seca Blue. The car is powered by a 3.2 liter S54 inline-six paired to a 6-speed manual transmission and is optioned with Cold Weather and Luxury Packages. Sold new in Houston, the car saw 14 years of single-owner service before moving to New England, where it was purchased by its third owner after this BaT auction in 2015. It has been driven approximately 14k miles in the ensuing 14 months and a comprehensive inspection and service were commissioned in May 2016 with the results included below. Dealer service receipts indicate regular maintenance as well as completion of recalls for rod bearings and Takata airbags, and the sale includes a clean Carfax and a clear Rhode Island title.",
      "Laguna Seca Blue paint retains an even gloss with occasional light swirls, and few finish flaws are visible in photos aside from occasional stone chips in the nose and a small dent near the driver\u2019s door handle as detailed in the gallery below. Remaining garaged since arriving in New England in 2015, the car has reportedly never seen snow or salt and is said to be free of exterior rust. Factory 18\u2033 satin chrome wheels show varying levels of curb rash and wear Toyo Proxes rubber installed at 56k miles with plenty of remaining tread.",
      "Plastic cladding looks free of distortion, though a small area of touched-up cracking is visible on the rear bumper cover along with scuffs on the underside of the front valance. Optional xenon headlights are equipped with washers and show minimal haze or pitting, and both fog lights were replaced in 2015 but are missing their plastic trim rings. Heated mirrors, washer jets, and door locks are standard items, while an optional glass moonroof and rain-sensing wipers are part of the Luxury Package. All accessories were verified in good condition during the 2016 inspection.",
      "Powered heated Nappa leather front seats feature adjustable-width backrests with wear limited to the bolsters on the driver\u2019s side. Carpets look plush and largely clean under protective mats. Both door panels are free of deformation and the textured dash looks straight and clean, while other plastics show areas of marking and typical fabric separation is present on several pillar trims. The multi-function thumbgrip wheel shows little evidence of use, though peeling is visible on the shift knob.",
      "Switchgear is brightly lettered, while instrumentation includes an odometer showing just under 67k miles and digital displays look free of dead pixels. An optional Harman Kardon sound system includes a six-CD changer and all interior functions were noted as working during the 2016 inspection. Several diagnostic trouble codes were also noted and cleared as described in the invoice below. Common gel failure is visible in the auto-darkening rearview mirror though it does not leak, and the oil level light occasionally illuminates despite being full.",
      "Power is from a stock 3.2 liter S54 straight six with Double VANOS valve timing that was good for 333 horsepower when new. A comprehensive inspection was performed 10k miles ago in May 2016 by Hans Imports of Rhode Island and included in-depth assessment of the drivetrain, braking, and suspension systems as noted in the gallery below. Oil passage expansion plugs were also replaced to alleviate a leak, and a synthetic oil change was performed along with installation of a new air filter and cleaning of the engine bay. A new water pump was installed in 2015 and spark plugs, fuel filter and PCV are due soon according to the inspection report.",
      "The 6-speed manual transmission feeds power rearward to a variable locking differential, and dynamic brake and stability control are also equipped. An earlier inspection noted none of the rear subframe issues common to the model and the underside looks free of notable damage in photos, while superficial corrosion appears limited to the stock exhaust system. Slight residual seepage is described from the transmission bell housing.",
      "Dealer service history is included from new and shows that a rod bearing recall was performed in October of 2004 along with a Takata airbag recall in September 2015. The car also comes with a detailed report from the 2016 inspection as well as original manuals and keys, six quarts of Castrol synthetic oil, and an original window sticker showing a total MSRP of just under $53k."

      "This 2002 BMW M3 has just over 24k miles and is an unmodified California car powered by a 3.2 liter S54 inline-six paired to a 6-speed manual transmission. Finished in silver over black, this example was recently acquired by the seller from the original owner. It has been used as an occasional driver throughout its life and has reportedly benefited from regular dealer maintenance as well as completed recalls for engine bearings and its passenger-side Takata airbag. A dealer-performed Inspection II was performed in August 2016, and the car is sold with a clean Carfax report along with a clear California title in the seller\u2019s name.",
      "Titan Silver paint retains a smooth gloss with few finish flaws visible in photos aside from occasional light marks, scuffs on the lower front valance, and road grime aft of the rear wheel wells. Sheet metal looks straight other than a small ding in the roof pictured in the gallery below. Crisp lines and even panel gaps are on display throughout, and no accidents are indicated in the Carfax report.",
      "Plastic cladding looks free of cracks or distortion. Some curbing is visible on each of the factory 18\u2033 wheels along with light oxidation of their satin chrome finish. Bridgestone RE760 Sport rubber is from 2010 and shows a decent amount of tread remaining. Lighting is shown to be working in photos and lenses appear free of haze or cracks throughout, including over the bi-xenon headlamps.",
      "Interior wear appears minimal, with leather surfaces showing occasional marks as well as light abrasion and wrinkling on the driver\u2019s bolsters. Carpets look plush and clean where visible beneath new OEM floor mats. Both door panels are deformation and the textured dash looks straight and clean. The multi-function thumbgrip wheel shows little evidence of use aside from a light shine around its rim, though some bubbling is noted on the the driver\u2019s door pull.",
      "Instrumentation remains clear and digital displays look free of dead pixels. The car was ordered with optional navigation and all switchgear retains bright lettering and functional backlighting. A replacement is included for the auto-dimming mirror, which exhibits typical failure and has leaked onto the ashtray cover below. The driver\u2019s seat belt retraction is said to be sluggish but operational.",
      "The stock 3.2 liter S54 inline-six features Double VANOS valve timing and produced 333 horsepower when new. The 6-speed manual transmission sends power to the rear wheels through a variable locking differential. The absence of a factory strut tower brace identifies the car as an early 2002 example.",
      "Warranty records are included in the gallery and show that recalls were carried out to replace the enigne\u2019s big-end bearings in 2003 and install revised bearing shells in 2005. The car has exhibited no symptoms of bearing-related trouble according to the seller. An additional completed recall is shown for the passenger-side Takata airbag, while a dealer-performed Inspection II in August 2016 revealed none of the rear subframe issues common to the model.",
      "The clean Carfax chronicles dealer visits through 2013, while two additional services were reportedly completed in 2014 and 2016 but are missing from the report. The car passed a California emissions test in December 2016 and is ready for transfer to its new owner. The seller has put 500 miles on the car and is selling to focus on a track-prepped version."

      "This 2002 BMW M3 Coupe is finished in Titanium Silver over Imola Red leather and has been modified with a 9psi supercharger, water/methanol injection, coilover suspension, performance exhaust, CSL body pieces, and more. The seller is an active BMW forum participant who purchased the car stock with 116k miles in 2013, and personally performed the mechanical modifications as well as adding ARC-8 wheels and a host of other cosmetic touches over the last four years. The car\u2019s S54 3.2-liter inline six and SMG automated manual gearbox remain internally stock and it has now traveled 137k miles. Described as fast and meticulously cared for, it is sold with an Autocheck report detailed below as well as a clean Pennsylvania title in the seller\u2019s name.",
      "An OEM M3 CSL trunk lid was imported from France and installed along with new side skirts and a dual-hole CSL-style front bumper cover with a carbon fiber lip. All were painted in Titanium Silver along with both rear quarter panels and the rear bumper cover, while the finish remains original from the doors forward and retains a high gloss thanks to covered storage out of the Pennsylvania weather. Signs of use up front appear limited to a handful of chips and occasional road marks commensurate with mileage.",
      "Panel gaps look consistent and two accidents indicated by the included Autocheck are noted as minor, although the report omits further details. Weighing in at 18 pounds apiece, anthracite Apex ARC-8 wheels are mounted with a 90mm stud conversion kit and 15mm rear spacers. All four are a \u201csquare\u201d 18\u00d79.5\u2033 rather than the factory staggered sizes to allow for easy rotation of their two-year-old Michelin Pilot Super Sport rubber, which shows plenty of tread remaining according to the seller.",
      "\u201cShadow\u201d window trim is joined by kidneys, grilles and sideview mirrors which have all been repainted in gloss black. Smoked corner markers complement a new set of retrofitted later-model factory LED taillights, xenon headlights with washers and new lenses, new side markers, and E92 LED license plate lights. The windshield cowl and lower rear window gasket have been replaced by the seller.",
      "A similar level of effort has gone into interior cosmetics and includes swapping a low-mileage Imola Red interior in place of the original gray seats and door panels, which are also included in the sale. Leather surfaces show occasional superficial cracks but minimal wrinkling or wear are evident even on driver\u2019s side bolsters. Matching door and rear side panels are free from deformation and show only light signs of use, while common pillar trim separation has been addressed with new covers. Carpets look devoid of major wear where visible in photos.",
      "The textured dash is clean and new Titanium Shadow trim has been installed throughout, while other plastics look devoid of cracks or excessive marking. A ZHP shift knob has been fitted, switchgear retains bright lettering, and the multi-function sport steering wheel rim shows some wear around the rim. The stereo is an updated factory unit from a later car and features an OEM auxiliary input. An armrest delete console features a roll-top \u201cEuro tray\u201d rather than the twin cupholders found in US-market cars, and the car is further optioned with heated seats, a sunroof and Park Distance Control.",
      "Modifications underhood consist of a Prima Plus supercharger kit from Active Autowerke which provides 9 psi of boost to the 3.2-liter inline six. The centrifugal supercharger is supplemented with a trunk-mounted water/methanol injection system along with a tune from Tuning Tech FS, a combination which is claimed by Active Autowerke to make over 500 horsepower at the rear wheels on 93-octane pump fuel.",
      "Shifting is from a stock SMG automated manual gearbox, and the seller suggests that while the clutch does not require immediate attention, it can be expected to have a shorter than typical life due to the forced-induction power. Exhaust is via catless black ceramic-coated headers, a resonated X-pipe, SCZA muffler and stainless tips from Status Gruppe. All combine for an aggressive sound without the rasp typical to other aftermarket E46 M3 systems according to the seller.",
      "Adjustable SRS coilovers from Status Gruppe are mounted with camber plates and use 700kg race springs up with 800kg units in the rear. The seller has driven the car a bit over 5k miles per year during his ownership, stating that it starts quickly whether hot or cold and drives well with the modifications. All modification work was performed personally by the seller, who notes approximately $20k in spending on modification parts alone since April 2013.",
      "Two accidents are reported on the included Autocheck, which also indicates an outstanding Takata airbag recall. An Inspection II was reportedly completed at 124k miles and the most recent oil change was performed at 133k miles, with the seller further noting that only Shell or Sunoco 93-octane fuel and Castrol 10W-60 oil have been used during his ownership. The fixed-back driver\u2019s seat visible in some photos has been removed, but original parts and spares include the full OEM gray interior and 18\u2033 wheels along with an extra set of 12mm wheel spacers."

The car had an MSRP of $62,995 and is optioned with the Cold Weather Package including heated seats, parking back-up sensors, Xenon Headlights, Harmon Kardon stereo, and 19\u2033 wheels. The 3.2 liter S54 inline-six is paired to a 6-speed manual and received a top-end rebuild by BMW in 2011 at 30k miles following damage to the valve train. The seller acquired the car over six years ago and reports that it has never been tracked. Modifications include Active Autowerke custom stainless headers and pipes, AFE intake, Dinan muffler, and an integrated Passport radar detector. A front-end alignment and oil/filer change were completed in November 2016 and the car is said to be running well with no current mechanical needs. This M3 is offered with service records covering the seller\u2019s ownership, an accident-free Carfax, original window sticker, manuals, BMW portfolio, and a clean Texas title in the seller\u2019s name.",
      "Carbon Black Metallic (416) is described as appearing black or very dark blue depending on light conditions. The finish has good shine throughout, and the seller indicates most of the paint is original. In anticipation of the sale, the rear bumper was repainted to address scuffs, and scratches were touched-up in several places on the passenger-side and around the driver-side front wheel. A passenger-side door ding was also professionally repaired and painted in 2014. A paint chip on the edge of the trunk lid above the M3 badge is shown in the gallery below.",
      "The optional 19\u2033 alloys show light curb marks to three wheels and heavier rash on the passenger-side rear item. Vredestein Ultrac Sessanta high performance rubber is fitted all around, with 50% tread life said to remain. A custom padded car cover is included with the sale and pictured in the gallery bellow.",
      "The Black leather (N5SW) interior is in good overall condition, with light creasing but no rips or tears. The driver\u2019s seat shows wear to the left bolster. Hard surfaces appear solid, with no cracks, chips, or missing pieces. Dark carpets appear solid and the driver\u2019s floor mat has worn through in the padded heel area.",
      "A Passport radar detector/laser deflector has been installed, with controls built into the cubby originally housing the ashtray. All four individual window switches function properly. The seller notes an intermittent issue with the switch to operate all windows simultaneously, where all four will lower together but only the rear windows raise up together.",
      "The 3.2 liter S54 inline-six has double-VANOS valve timing and delivered 333 horsepower when new in US-spec. Modifications include a cold air intake from Advanced Flow Engineering and an Active Autowerke performance chip. The seller reports a top-end engine rebuild by BMW at 30k miles, after broken bolts from the Vanos adjustment unit to the intake camshaft caused one broken rocker arm and bent intake valves. An October 2011 service report and a February 2017 summary from BMW are pictured in the gallery and describe the rebuild, which included:",
      "Custom stainless headers and pipes from Active Autowerke were added about 2,700 miles ago and are pictured here next to the original parts. A Dinan muffler was also installed at the same time.",
      "Undercarriage photos show a clean and dry car, with no indications of damage or prior repairs. A sub-frame inspection and installation of new sub-frame mounts were completed March 2011 at a BMW dealership according to the seller. The car is equipped with a Getrag 420G 6-speed manual and is said to run and drive well. Stainless Goodridge brake lines were added less than 5k miles ago, and are reported to provide a firmer and more responsive brake pedal.",
      "The accident-free Carfax includes some gaps in vehicle history and supports the indicated mileage. The seller reports that the open recall item was an airbag part issue, with the service since completed and on record with BMW. The original window sticker can be seen in the gallery below.",
      "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0EOq75K23g",

It is powered by a 3.2 liter S54 inline-six paired to a 6-speed manual transmission and was a daily driver that is said to have been garaged in San Diego since first purchased.

      "The Carbon Black Metallic (#416) paint is believed original and presents well for its age. Noted imperfections include an indentation along the roof line edge above the passenger door and a slight scrape in the rocker panel under the passenger door. The seller mentions a slight bulge on the bottom of the front air dam under the passenger side fog light and replacement plastic splash panel in front of the right front wheel.",
      "The included Carfax reports a rear-end collision in 2012 and that the airbags did not deploy. Factory 18\u201d wheels show light curb damage and are wrapped in a new set of Hankook Ventus S1 Noble 255/40ZR rubber.",

      "As seen above, the odometer currently reads 105,634 miles. Currently there are no codes or alarms.",
      "The 3.2 liter S54 inline-six was good for 333 horsepower when new and features Double VANOS valve timing. This E46 is said to track straight and shift smoothly. The seller mentions a squeaking from the brakes when lightly applied, though the pads are said to have plenty of life.",
      "The 6-speed manual transmission feeds power to the rear wheels through a variable locking differential. The underside appears free of notable damage and additional detailed photos can be viewed in the gallery.",

Finished in Titanium Silver over Black, the car is powered by a 3.2-liter inline-six paired to a 6-speed manual transmission. Factory equipment includes the Premium Package, Cold Weather Package, Bi-Xenon headlamps, a Harman/Kardon stereo, and more. The car is said to be up-to-date on servicing, with the most recent maintenance performed in December 2016. This M3 is offered by a friend of the current owner with a 100+ photo gallery, some service records, an accident-free AutoCheck, and a clear Virginia title.",
      "Titanium Silver paint is said to remain original aside from the front bumper, which was refinished at some point and had its amber markers deleted. The seller states that it looks like some curb damage was repaired as there is some peeling of the clearcoat around the fog lights, small cracks below the fog lights, and a minor run in the clearcoat on the passenger-side. Some dings and scratches on the rocker panels are also noted, and exterior flaws are detailed in the gallery.",
      "18\u2033 alloys are wrapped in Continental Extreme Contact DW tires fitted in December 2016. Three of the wheels show marks, and each corner is highlighted in the photo gallery below. The seller states that the struts/shocks and bushings are tight with no play, and the rear differential does not whine or leak. Rear parking sensors were optioned from the factory.",
      "Inside, the Black leather upholstery looks to be in tidy condition with little discernible wear aside from minor creasing on the driver\u2019s bolsters. The seller notes that the passenger and rear seats look to have been rarely used.",
      "This M3 was optioned with the Premium Package (power seats, adjustable lumbar support, power sunroof, harman/kardon audio) and Cold Weather Package (Bi-Xenon headlights, headlight washers, heated seats, ski bag). The seller states that all features, electronics, lighting, and instrumentation are in good working order. One ding in the aluminum trim above the glove box is highlighted in the photo gallery.",
      "The 3.2-liter inline-six is reportedly up-to-date on servicing. The most recent maintenance was performed in December 2016 at 16k miles by Momentum BMW in Texas consisting of a new battery, oil change, all fluids including brake and power steering, a fuel service, alignment, and recalls for the DME control module and driver/passenger airbags. Service records from West German BMW in Pennsylvania from 2003 to 2007 up to 10k miles will also be included.",
      "The undercarriage is described as free of any known rust with crack-free subframe mounts and no apparent damage throughout.",
      "The AutoCheck report shows this to be a single-owner car, though the original owner recently sold it to the seller. No accidents or issues are shown and the car was registered in Pennsylvania from new until the end of 2016. As per the seller, this low-mile E46 M3 is available for in-person or professional pre-purchase inspections at the buyer\u2019s expense."

      "This 2005 BMW M3 is equipped with the Competition Package and is a two-owner example that shows 48k miles. Special ordered through BMW Individual in Stratus Grey with no sunroof, the car was also fitted with a CSL rear decklid spoiler when new. It has resided in the Atlanta, Georgia area its whole life and was serviced by a single technician at the local BMW dealer until the seller acquired it in 2014. Powered by an unmodified 3.2-liter S54 inline-six backed by an SMG sequential manual transmission, the car features an M-Tech Alcantara and leather interior. This E46 is sold with a clean Carfax, records back to new, and a clean Georgia title in the seller\u2019s name.",
      "The Competition Package bridged the gap between the standard M3 and the M3 CSL, which was not offered in the US. The special order Stratus Grey (440) paintwork shows a small chip near the 3M guards on the hood, and the 3M guards on the mirrors have discolored slightly. No other marks are noted. The stock grilles have been replaced with aftermarket items with carbon fiber surrounds.",
      "This car has been equipped with the CSL rear spoiler from new, and the Competition Package included 19\u2033 wheels.",
      "This car is equipped with an M-Tech partial Alcantara interior with leather bolsters. Apart from an integrated radar detector and jammer, the cabin retains all stock equipment. Some general wear and tear is apparent in higher traffic areas, and all interior features are said to work correctly.",
      "There is wear visible on the driver\u2019s outer bolsters as seen above, and both the front and rear seats are further detailed in the gallery below.",
      "The S54 3.2-liter inline-six is mechanically unmodified, and the car was reportedly maintained by a single tech at one BMW dealership by the original owner. The car was last serviced in late 2015 with a brake job and fluid changes of the engine, differential, and transmission. The only noted performance modification is a Dinan rear strut bar. Other services are documented in a printed maintenance log from Global BMW in Atlanta, Georgia.",
      "The seller has records back to new, including a maintenance log from the BMW dealer that has serviced the car from new. The original books and manuals are also included along with the original window sticker, which shows an MSRP of $62,165 due to nearly $15k in options. The clean Carfax can be viewed in the gallery below."

The paint is believed to be original, and the car was ordered with the Cold Weather Package. It was reportedly garaged for a few years by the previous owner and rarely driven.

This E46 M3 is sold with an accident-free Carfax and a clean Pennsylvania title in the seller\u2019s name.",

The seller has driven it 200 miles and notes no issues, stating that the rod bearing issue that plagues some E46 M3 cars has been corrected by a previous owner.",
      "The Carfax was recently issued and shows two owners prior to 2013, with no recorded incidents of damage or loss. Maintenance reports are sporadic, with no data for the periods from 2005-2013 and 2014-present. A driver\u2019s airbag recall issued in 2015 remains outstanding."

Approximately 6k miles have been added during the seller\u2019s two years of ownership, and this E46 is now being offered with accident-free Carfax and AutoCheck reports, the original window sticker, and a clean California title in the seller\u2019s name.",
      "The Silver Grey Metallic paint shows some minor rock chips on the hood and front of the rear quarter panels.

Receipts document a cooling system rebuild with stock parts, and the seller replaced the crankshaft seal and driveshaft input seal after hours at the shop in which he works. At this time, the differential was dropped and fluid levels were checked. The temperature sensor was recently replaced, but the oil level sensor is in need of replacement.",

A 6-speed manual gearbox was equipped on just under half of the E46 M3s produced and feeds power to the rear wheels through a standard variable locking differential. No subframe cracking is present according to the seller.",
      "The included Carfax report verifies single ownership and shows no accidents, thefts, or other issues. Service records are described as as fairly extensive, and the last work performed was a parking brake repair in August 2016, with little mileage added since."

      "This 2005 BMW M3 Coupe shows just over 65k miles and is powered by a 3.2-liter S54 inline-six paired to a 6-speed manual transmission. Delivered new to Georgia, the car was leased by an executive for eight months and purchased by the second owner in February 2006. He kept it in Florida through late 2011, when it was purchased by Enthusiast Auto Group in Cincinnati, Ohio. EAG serviced this sunroof-delete example with a new constant pressure valve, flex disc, drive belts, rear trailing arm bushings, and more before the seller bought it in March 2012. He has added nearly 18k miles in the last five years and maintained the car with oil/filter changes, new fuel and air filters, brake and ignition service, a new alternator, and new tires. Status Gruppe headers and BC coilovers were also fitted. This E46 M3 is sold with records for the work done by EAG, receipts from the seller, a clean AutoCheck, and a clean Michigan title in the seller\u2019s name.",
      "The previous owner repainted the hood, front fenders, and rear bumper due to chips, and the seller notes that the color matches well. The Silver Grey Metallic (A08) paint shows two small chips on the edge of the driver\u2019s door and a small scratch on the right corner of the rear bumper being the only notable faults. Having been stored every winter since its been in Michigan, the car is said to have never seen snow and has been professionally detailed twice a year.",
      "A set of BC Racing coilovers were installed by the seller, and the brakes were serviced with an ECS tuning kit that included Textar pads and Meyle rotors in August 2016. The stock 19\u2033 alloys were fitted with Hankook Ventus V12 EVO2 tires last November.",
      "Inside the cabin, the black leather interior appears to be in good condition with normal wear showing on the seat bolsters. The car came from the factory with sunroof delete and manual seats, and the seller has added an OEM lighted ZHP shift knob, 330d shift lever, and Umnitza LED interior lighting. EAG replaced the rear view mirror and the interior A-pillars, though the headliner cloth is said to be slightly sagging near the middle of the rear portion. A Parrot Bluetooth kit was already installed when the seller acquired the car.",
      "All of the gauges, power accessories, stock Business radio, and A/C system are said to function properly, and the odometer reads 65,334 miles. Thinking he would perform the airbag recall himself, the seller removed the airbag fuse from the glove box. After deciding it would be better serviced at a dealership he replaced the fuse and the SRS light has been on ever since.",
      "https://vimeo.com/218836850",
      "The walkaround video above shows the interior and exterior condition of the car.",
      "The 3.2-liter S54 inline-six is paired to a Getrag 6-speed manual and has been modified with Status Gruppe headers. Service performed in late 2011 by EAG included the replacement of the constant pressure valve, flex disc, accessory drive belts, rear trailing arm bushings, and battery. The seller has performed the following maintenance:",
      "An accident-free AutoCheck shows the ownership history, while the original owner\u2019s manual, keys, and emergency kit in the trunk well are included. No service records from previous owners were passed down, though an invoice for the work done by EAG and receipts for the maintenance and modifications performed by the seller come with the car. The seller purchased the vehicle completely stock and has retained all the original OEM parts for the buyer."

The car was sold new in Washington and stayed there until being purchased in September 2014 by the seller, who drove it down Highway 1 to Los Angeles before moving to Dallas, Texas in May 2015. This example is equipped with the Cold Weather Package, and the stock 18\u2033 wheels were recently powder coated. The seller has added 20k miles during his ownership and serviced the car every 5k miles with oil changes and an inspection. Maintenance performed 500 miles ago included new rear brakes, coils, plugs, and an oil pan gasket. This E46 M3 is sold with service records back to 2014, a clean Carfax, and a clean Washington title in the seller\u2019s name.",
      "The Titanium Silver Metallic paint shows some normal wear, including a few small chips on the nose.

The seller has serviced the E46 in consistent intervals at certified BMW service centers with fluid changes and inspections, and a Texas Safety and Emissions test was passed last month. Maintenance performed under current ownership includes the following:",
      "A collection of undercarriage photos have been included in the image gallery below. The seller had a PPI done when he bought the car to check for any VANOS issues or cracking in the rear subframe. The PPI reported no issues were present, and a recent inspection showed no cracking was apparent.",
      "An accident-free Carfax shows ownership history and verifies mileage. The car comes with a binder full of service records from the seller\u2019s three years of ownership. The original trunk mounted toolkit is also included."

The seller purchased this example in 2010 and recently relocated it to his home in Massachusetts. Powered by a 3.2-liter S54 inline-six, the car has been modified with ZCP wheels, Eibach Springs, an Active Autowerke Exhaust, and a Rasp Pipe. This E46 M3 is now being offered in Boston with service records from new, a clean Carfax, and a clean Florida title in the seller\u2019s name.",

The seller reports he had the front bumper repainted due to rock chips from normal driving, and that the car has no history of any accidents. Stored each winter in a climate controlled garage, the M3 is only driven on weekends with nice weather during warmer months.",

      "Inside, the Cinnamon Nappa leather interior is in good shape, with seats appearing as if they have seen little use. This color interior was an $1,100 option ordered by the original owner that when joined with the Steel Gray exterior makes for a very rare color combination.",

      "The S54 3.2-liter inline-six has been modified with an Active Autowerke Exhaust and Rogue Engineering Rasp Pipe. The rod bearing recall was done at 2k miles, the Full Inspection II with valve adjustment was done at ~25k miles, and the car is serviced annually each spring. The most recent service was an oil/filter change in 2017. The seller has not upgraded the VANOS and subframe given the low mileage, and reports no issues with either.",

Proper maintenance has been done over the seller\u2019s ownership with many records available by the seller as well as documentation on the included Carfax report. The seller has stated that the M3 has not been affected by the rod bearing issue known to affect some 2001\u20132003 S54 engines. An oil change was recently conducted and a new battery was installed at 68,459 miles.",
      "Stock 18\u2033 wheels have a factory finish and show curb rash. The front tires are Bridgestone Potenza tires, while the rears are Sumitomo HTR ZII. Two fresh tires were added at 67k miles. No underbody photos are shown, but as a California car since new it should have no significant rust issues.",

Finished in Carbon Black Metallic over gray leather, this example was leased in North Carolina for its first 5,500 miles and has had one subsequent owner in Virginia prior to its recent acquisition by the seller. It comes with a clean AutoCheck report and a clear Maryland title in the seller\u2019s name.",
      "Carbon Black Metallic paint reads as a dark blue under strong sunlight and is detailed in several close-up photos below. The Competition Package included staggered-width 19\u2033 split-spoke wheels, here wearing Continental ExtremeContact DWS tires from 2010 and 2011. Curb rash is shown in the photos below, though few other blemishes are present according to the seller.",

Light wear is present on the outer seat bolsters and shift knob, while the seller notes the absence of common issues such as drooping pillar covers or leaks from the rear view mirror.",
      "Gray-faced instrumentation includes a 185 mph speedo and a digital odometer showing just under 52k miles, a handful of which have been added by the seller. A power sunroof is equipped and the factory DVD-based navigation system is retained in the dash, though the ZCP wheel eliminates cruise control from the model.",
      "The 3.2-liter S54 straight six is backed by a 6-speed manual gearbox. ZCP cars featured a quicker steering ratio and track mode for Dynamic Stability Control along with 13.7\u2033 front and 12.9\u2033 rear cross-drilled brake rotors. This one reportedly passed a Virginia state inspection just before the seller\u2019s purchase and a tune-up will be performed prior to the auction\u2019s close. This car has been inspected for common E46 M3 problems such as subframe cracking and VANOS issues, both of which are said to be absent here.",
      "The Autocheck report shows no accidents or thefts. An Inspection 1 is reportedly noted in the owner\u2019s manual and further dealer maintenance is said to be indicated by records procured from BMW by the seller.",
      "A partial factory tool kit and air compressor are included in the sale along with spare keys, period brochures and other literature."

      "This 2006 BMW M3 coupe has just 36,659 miles and is a 6-speed manual example finished in Carbon Black over black leather. The first owner was from Westbury, New York and had the car serviced at Rallye BMW. The current owner acquired it around one month ago from its second caretaker, who purchased this example in 2009 and kept it in League City, Texas and then Virginia. This E46 has been kept mechanically stock from new, including the 3.2-liter S54 inline-six. Recently, Richmond BMW performed a full inspection and service at a cost of $2,288 as detailed below. This M3 is now offered on behalf of the current owner with clear Carfax and AutoCheck reports, one key and alarm fob, and a clean Virginia title.",
      "As part of the recent work performed at Richmond BMW, the front bumper was repainted, several dings were removed, and all four factory 18\u2033 alloy wheels were refinished. Remaining flaws are listed as dings at the top seam of the passenger door and on the lower driver-side quarter panel in front of the wheel, in addition to a scratch on the passenger\u2019s rear quarter panel near the fuel door, a number of minor scratches on the trunk lid, and a notable scratch on the rear passenger-side bumper trim. All flaws are highlighted in the detailed photo gallery below and the seller notes this M3 would benefit from a professional detail/paint correction.",
      "The newly refinished wheels are highlighted in the photo gallery below and wear Toyo Proxes T1R tires at all four corners. New ABS-DSC sensors were fitted by Richmond BMW, and an aftermarket alarm system has been added.",
      "Inside, the factory black leather upholstery has been well-kept, with the seller noting only minor wear on the driver\u2019s seat bolstering as shown above. Everything has been left stock aside from an LCD touchscreen Alpine stereo head-unit. All equipment is reported to be in good working order, including the heated seats, sunroof, and power accessories.",
      "Two open airbag recalls were recently completed by Richmond BMW. The seller describes interior flaws as some scuffs on the passenger door panel and delaminating A/C-pillar trim, all of which is shown in the photo gallery.",
      "The 3.2-liter S54 inline-six has been kept in stock condition from new. The second owner maintained the car at League City BMW. A full mechanical inspection was performed by Richmond BMW on April 29, 2017, and the car received a clean bill of health as shown via the five-page document in the picture gallery. The three-page $2,288 service receipt is also displayed. According to the seller, the engine starts easily and provides smooth power, while the 6-speed manual provides positive shifts in all gears.",
      "Accident-free Carfax and AutoCheck history reports are provided in the photo gallery and show two owners prior to the current owner. 18 service history records are also displayed. Three videos of the E46 are shown below:",

A Dr. Vanos replacement VANOS system was installed in 2012, and the cooling system was replaced in 2014. A new CPV valve has also been installed. The SMG clutch is reported to grip well, and a recent subframe inspection did not reveal any cracking.",

Equipped with an S54 3.2L straight-six and an SMG II sequential manual transmission, the car was purchased new at BMW of Seattle and has been dealer-serviced since new. Selected features from new included the Phoenix Yellow Metallic finish, manual seats, xenon headlights, and parking distance control. Regular mechanical service has been performed, including a rod bearing recall in 2004. Rear subframe welds were inspected in 2009 and again in preparation for sale. The Inspection II service with valve adjustment was performed in 2013 at 26k miles. The selling dealer has added 3k miles and reports that it drives smoothly and shows no outstanding issues. This E46 M3 is sold with a clear Carfax and a clean Colorado title.",
      "The Phoenix Yellow Metallic paint was an exclusive M3 color. Additionally, the car was optioned with a sunroof, Xenon lighting, and Parking Distance Sensors. No evidence of repainting is noted, all panels are original, and a paint gauge report is provided with the gallery photographs. The Carfax shows an accident-free history.",
      "Forward surfaces have reportedly been protected by a clear bra covering since new. A couple isolated chips in the clear bra can be seen around the front tow loop socket. 18\u2033 split-spoke M alloys wear Continental Extreme Contact tires measuring 225/45 up front and 255/40 out back. Side skirts were damaged on a lift during the auction, but the seller has ordered new skirts and they will be painted and installed prior to delivery.",
      "The black interior features Titan Shadow trim, an optional armrest, and an SMG II 6-speed sequential manual transmission. The dash and doors remain free of scuffs and carpets are protected with //M embroidered mats. The seller notes that airbag, and DME and SMG programming recalls have been performed. The odometer shows 32,819 miles.",
      "The car was optioned with manual Black leather sport seats, and the upholstery shows little wear outside of minor creasing at the corners of the driver\u2019s seat cushion bolsters. The storage compartment cover forward of the shifter and the cup holders in the center console also have minor scuffs.",
      "A factory toolkit is equipped beneath the rear deck lid. A lug wrench was not provided on the M3 due to the included Mobility Kit, but the selling dealer has sourced one that will be included in the sale.",
      "The S54 inline-six is backed by an SMG II 6-speed sequential shift transmission with a computer-controlled hydraulic clutch actuation. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a limited-slip differential. VANOS variable valve timing and individual throttle bodies lead to a factory rating of 333hp and 262 lb-ft of torque.

Finished in Silver Grey Metallic over a Grey Nappa leather interior, the car has been modified with CSL headers and wider front wheels, along with a number of aftermarket components from Dinan, Turner Motorsports, StopTech, and Evolve Tuning. Work within the past 5k miles included new tires, a four-wheel alignment has been performed, replacement motor mounts, new brakes, and more.

A CSL-style trunk lid has also been added.",

Power comes from an S54 3.2L inline-six paired with a 6-speed manual transmission. Originally a special order for the Business Manager of BMW South in Miami, Florida, the car has had two owners and was purchased by the seller in August 2006 with 6k miles. 110k miles have been driven since, and the car remains unmodified apart from a Sirius XM satellite radio. Both incidents are noted on the Carfax, which records no other issues. Service records from 2006 to present are included in the sale, and the car received an oil change and inspection in preparation for sale. This Competition Package E46 M3 is sold with service records, a Carfax, and a clean Florida title.",

Shortly after the seller\u2019s purchase, the car was involved in a minor front-end accident in which airbags did not deploy, and more recently the bumper was replaced after an parking lot curb strike. The body has also received paint repair for clear coat separation on the hood and a garage scrape. Some scratches and chips can be seen around the nose of the car currently. Receipts for bodywork are shown in gallery photographs below.",
      "The seller mentions a few bubbles in the passenger-side window tint. The factory 19\u2033 wheels were borrowed from the Euro-spec M3 CSL, and show some curb damage. Tires are Bridgestone Potenzas, with rears showing 5k Miles of wear, and fronts that will require replacement in the near future. The seller reports that the car has been garage-kept throughout his ownership.",
      "Competition Package interior enhancements include the aluminum trim accents, and an Alcantara-wrapped steering wheel that has been covered with an aftermarket item. The three-spoke wheel is equipped with a \u201cTrack Mode\u201d button that raises the engagement threshold on the Dynamic Stability Control system. A Harman Kardon sound system was optioned at purchase and a Sirius satellite radio was installed by the seller. Leather sport seats have cloth inserts and show some creasing around the bolsters. The headliner and rear view mirror were replaced in 2016. 116,005 miles are shown on the digital odometer.",

Within the last two years, the control arm bushings have been replaced, a new battery installed, and both airbag recalls performed. In 2017, the VANOS unit was adjusted and valve cover gasket replaced, and the cooling system serviced with a new water pump, expansion tank line, fan clutch, thermostat, drive belts, and idler and tensioner pulleys. The parking brake was adjusted, oil changed, and a general inspection performed in preparation for the sale.",

      "This 2006 BMW M3 is equipped with the Competition Package, a 3.2-liter S54 inline-six, and a 6-speed manual transmission. Finished in Silver Gray Metallic with a Cinnamon leather interior, the car is optioned with a moonroof, power front seats with memory, Xenon headlights, and Harman Kardon sound system. The seller reports that he purchased the car new but registered it in other people\u2019s names until recently. Now showing 106k miles, this example has been fitted with numerous modifications to the interior, exterior, engine, and suspension, including a preemptive Turner Motorsport subframe reinforcement kit. The seller has completed most maintenance personally, often performing interval services ahead of schedule. This E46 M3 most recently passed a California smog check in July 2016 and is now being offered with an accident-free Carfax report, original window sticker/manuals, receipts for most parts purchases, and a clean California title in the seller\u2019s name.",
      "The Silver Gray Metallic finish (A08) benefits from a front-end respray to address rock chips. The seller reports this M3 has been garaged from new, and has no accident history or prior bodywork. The Euro front bumper has no license plate holes drilled, but does have a dime-sized mark as shown in gallery phots. 19\u2033 Competition Package alloy wheels have BMW center caps and wear Kumho Ecsta PS91 tires all around.",
      "The seller has added BMW front wheel hubs and front/rear wheel bearings, as well as Rogue Engineering wheel spacers (18mm front / 15mm rear) with extended bolts. A four-wheel alignment was recently performed, and a Turner Motorsport E46 Rear Chassis/Subframe Reinforcement Kit has been installed, although an inspection by Performance Technic of Fremont, California showed no subframe cracking issues.",
      "Shortly after buying the car, the seller completed an interior swap from original Black leather (N5SW) to Cinnamon, adding elements of the Cold Weather Package at the same time. A Pioneer AVIC-Z140BH touchscreen navigation system with Bluetooth, reverse camera, and USB connectivity has been installed along with hardwiring for Valentine One radar detector which is not included.",
      "Further interior modifications have included adding the following equipment and trim:",
      "The 3.2-liter S54 inline-six features 24-valves, double-VANOS variable valve timing, and was rated at 333 hp when new. Maintenance by the seller has included:",
      "Other updates have included adding these parts and equipment:",
      "The exhaust system now includes a BMW Euro cat Section 1 and thermal ceramic coated BMW Euro headers. Other underside updates include:",
      "This window sticker confirms original colors and options. The Competition Package contributed $4,000 to the $58,490 total MSRP and added compound brakes, cross-drilled rotors, light alloy wheels, aluminum interior trim, and an M-sport steering wheel.",
      "This Carfax shows no accidents or damage and includes several gaps in vehicle history. Although the report captures records from three California owners, the seller indicates the car has been with him from new and was registered to other family members for personal reasons.",
      "The four videos above provide these views:"

The original owner purchased it from BMW of Henderson, Nevada and had it until 2010 with 45k miles. The second owner added 6k miles before selling to the current owner in Colorado in 2015. The car has received regular and scheduled maintenance throughout its life, including the S54 rod bearing recall performed in 2004, new driveline fluids, and an SMG programming update. Inspection of the rear subframe revealed no issues. The Inspection II service and 60k-mile valve adjustment were performed prior to the sale. The Carfax shows no accidents and service records date back to new. This E46 M3 SMG is sold on consignment by the selling dealer with a clear Colorado title.",
      "The car has been stored indoors and clear stone guards have been applied to the front air dam and hood. Panels are all said to be original with the factory VIN tag in place. The hood bra has since been removed but the bumper covering remains in place and shows several small scratches. The seller mentions one touchup visible on the trunk trim above the license plate.",
      "All glass and lenses are said to be clear and free of chips and cracks. Nineteen-inch Style 67 alloy wheels show only one spot of curb rash on the left rear wheel, and wear new Michelin Pilot Sport A/S 3 tires measuring 225/40 up front, and 265/30 at the rear.",
      "The Black Nappa Leather interior features brushed aluminum accents and includes a Harmon Kardon sound system, power-adjusted memory seats, an electric moon roof, and parking distance control. The seller states that all interior equipment is functional, including the auto-dimming rearview mirror, and digital displays that are free of dead pixels. The digital odometer shows 59,477 miles.",
      "The seller states that a little wear can be found on interior surfaces, though the seats present with minor creasing and bolster flattening, and some wear can be seen on the center console and door handle.",
      "The 3.2-Liter S54B32 inline-six cylinder engine is paired with a 6-speed SMG II sequential manual transmission. Power was rated at 333hp in factory tune, and the car is said to be unmodified in any way. Service receipts and a factory service booklet show a history of regular and scheduled maintenance over the life of the car; the car was serviced exclusively at BMW dealerships until 2010. The S54 rod bearing recall was conducted in 2004 at 17.5k miles, and the SMG has received updated programming. Transmission and differential fluids were recently changed, and an Inspection II service and 60k-mile valve adjustment were performed prior to the auction. The results of a Blackstone oil analysis can be found in the gallery.",
      "The factory tool kit is complete and resides below the rear deck lid. No jack or lug wrench are included due to the inclusion of the Mobility Kit. Subframe welds have been inspected periodically over the life of the car, and the seller states that no issues have developed.",
      "Service records have been preserved from purchase in the binder pictured above, and a recent Carfax reports an accident-free history with three owners in Nevada, Iowa, and Colorado. A full collection of factory and dealer literature is included, along with a VHS cassette and BMW Performance Delivery Center binder. A list of optional equipment selected is as follows:"

The car was purchased new at Elmhurst BMW in Illinois and optioned with the Premium and Cold Weather Packages. It remained in the suburban Chicago area prior to the seller, who purchased the car in 2010 and moved it to Michigan. The car has since been driven 20k miles seasonally, and it has reportedly been stored covered and indoors. Service was performed exclusively at BMW dealerships and marque specialty shops, and the recalls for rod bearings, subframe welds, and airbags have been addressed. The car is described as unmodified apart from 18\u2033 M3 CSL replica wheels, a CSL-style rear splitter, and a Scorza muffler. This E46 M3 is sold with a clean Carfax report, records back to 2007, and a clear Michigan title in the seller\u2019s name.",
      "The Titanium Silver paint is the factory color, and a CSL-style rear diffuser has been added. Minimal stone chips are noted, and two touch ups can be seen on the passenger-side front fender. Other blemishes mentioned are a gash on the driver-side rocker molding and evidence of paintless dent removal near the deck lid. The seller reports that the car was garaged and seasonally driven over most of its life. Parking Distance Control sensors can be seen on the rear bumper.",
      "Window and door seals were replaced in 2012, while new OEM taillights and front turn signal lenses were fitted this year. Exterior bulbs has been replaced all around, and European-market side view mirrors were installed. 18\u2033 CSL replica wheels were manufactured by VMR, and Bridgestone Potenzas were installed about 20k miles ago in 2010.",
      "The interior is equipped with black Nappa leather, as well as the Premium and Cold Weather Packages. Features include a power moonroof, heated memory seats, a folding rear bench, and a pass-through ski bag. The center console and window actuators were replaced by the seller, and an OEM MP3 auxiliary jack was added. Bavarian Soundwerks speakers and a lighted OEM M3 shift knob have also been installed. The auto-dimming rearview mirror was rebuilt and interior bulbs were replaced. The A/C is said to blow cold and interior equipment is said to function as-designed, with no dead pixel issues in the digital displays.",
      "The upholstery shows bolster wear and flattening on the driver\u2019s seat, and an airbag recall was completed earlier this year. The sunroof seal was replaced by the previous owner, while the door seals were replaced under the seller. The split rear bench shows little evidence of use.",
      "The 3.2-liter S54 inline-six was rated at 333 hp when new and is paired to a 6-speed manual transmission. Shortly after the seller\u2019s purchase, the car received a new driveshaft flex disc, fuel filter, water pump, tensioner unit, and thermostat gasket. A new oil pan was installed by a previous owner. The S54 rod bearing recall was performed in 2008, and a weep was noted at the rear pinion seal following an inspection.",
      "A complete factory tool kit, spare tire, and jack can be found in the trunk.",
      "The seller has provided a collection of photographs detailing the underside, and the rear subframe recall was addressed in 2010. New control arm bushings were installed, as was the Scorza muffler seen above.",
      "Documentation includes factory manuals and sales literature, a list of services performed between 2001-2007, most records covering 2007-present, and a Carfax detailing an accident-free history in suburban Chicago under four prior owners. A walk-around video can be seen below."

      "This 2005 BMW M3 is a largely stock convertible with 59k indicated miles on its 3.2-liter S54 inline-six and 6-speed manual transmission. Finished in Mystic Blue over black leather and equipped with the Cold Weather Package, the car spent its early years in the Southeast and Michigan before coming to West Virginia following the seller\u2019s acquisition in 2014. Work over the last three years included paint correction, new radiator hoses, a VANOS repair, and replacement of suspension components as described below. This E46 convertible is sold with a clean Carfax report and a clear West Virginia title.",
      "Mystic Blue Metallic paint has been extensively polished by the seller to bring it to its current condition. Rock chips are noted on the front end, and a small area of crazing is pointed out in the photos below. Some paintwork has likely been carried out according to the seller, who cites remnants of masking tape on the grilles and a faint line on a rear quarter panel. No accidents are shown on the Carfax report.",
      "Factory 19\u2033 polished split-spokes wear Continental and Michelin tires mixed front to rear, all of which show plenty of tread according to the seller. New lenses has been installed over the xenon headlamps, which feature built-in washers as part of the Cold Weather Package. The fabric convertible top houses a heated glass window and is demonstrated as operable in photos.",
      "Interior condition is described as clean aside from cracking in the powered driver\u2019s leather sport seat. The car was ordered with the Cold Weather Package, which included heated seats as well as rain-sensing wipers. The cabin air filter and power window switches have been replaced by the seller.",
      "Instrumentation includes a 185 mph speedo and the digital odometer reportedly shows 59k miles, nearly 20k of which were added by the seller. The factory optional Harmon Kardon stereo system remains mounted in the center stack. An illuminated dash light is said to indicate malfunction of the tire pressure monitoring system.",
      "The 3.2L S54 inline-six was factory rated at 333 horsepower for the US market. Upper and lower radiator hoses were replaced with blue Mishimoto silicone items during the seller\u2019s ownership, and drive belts are also newer. A 2016 VANOS failure was repaired with a used OEM hub and an upgraded oil pump disk from Beisan Systems. All new hardware was used for the project, though no seals or solenoids were replaced. A new evap purge valve should be installed soon according to the seller.",
      "Roughly half of E46 M3 convertibles were fitted with 6-speed manual gearboxes, here featuring a rebuilt shifter. An M Performance front strut brace has been fitted, and both front control arms and ball joints were replaced during the seller\u2019s ownership. Rear trailing arm bushings are also newer, as are brake rotors and pads. The rear subframe mounting points have reportedly been checked at regular intervals.",
      "The Carfax report dates from late 2016 and shows no accidents, thefts, or other issues aside from an open recall for the Takata driver-side airbag. Regular maintenance has been performed for the seller by a mechanic friend, though few records are available. The 60k-mile Inspection II has not yet been completed per the seller. The car is sold with a partial tool kit and other factory accessories."

It has been with the seller since August 2017 and comes equipped with Ground Control coilovers, a Brembo big brake kit, Volk 18\u201d alloys, CSL trunk lid, and more. The S54 3.2-liter inline-six underwent a rod bearing recall at 35k miles and the six-speed manual gearbox was replaced under warranty less than 40k miles ago. Further modifications include ceramic-coated Euro headers, a Supersprint exhaust, and Dinan rear differential. This E46 M3 is now being offered with service records back to 2004, a clean Carfax, original parts, and a clear Kentucky title in the seller\u2019s name.",
      "To the seller\u2019s knowledge, the Titanium Silver finish remains original. The CSL trunk lid and carbon fiber rear diffuser were installed by a previous owner in 2007. Further cosmetic upgrades include blacked-out kidney grilles and side vents. The original windshield seal and rear quarter glass rubber shows signs of deterioration, and the driver\u2019s side rearview mirror has begun to delaminate.",
      "One-piece Forged Volk TE37SL pressed-graphite colored rims in 8.5\u2033 front and 9.5\u2033 rear widths are fitted with Michelin Pilot A/S 3 rubber. Braking has been upgraded with a Brembo big brake kit, comprised of upgraded calipers, drilled rotors, and stainless lines in the front and rear. Suspension modifications include a set of Ground Control coilovers and control arms, along with stiffer Rogue Engineering control arm bushings and shock mounts. No signs of cracking were evident on the rear subframe during the recent PPI.",
      "Black Nappa Leather seats are heated and power adjustable with optional 4-way lumbar support. ZHP black cubed aluminum trim, black leather door cards, F-series M3 shift knob, and custom shift boot have also been installed. The rearview mirror shows signs of delamination around the edges. Piano black rear-armrests are currently installed, although a set of matching cubed-aluminum ones are included with the sale. 80K miles are shown on the odometer and believed accurate.",
      "The S54 inline-six has been modified with a set of Euro headers, which have been custom-finished in a blue ceramic coating from Jet-Hot. Further exhaust modifications include a Euro section tied into a SuperSprint section II and rear silencer. Drivetrain modifications include a Dinan 3.91 rear differential and Rogue Engineering short shifter and transmission mount.",
      "The included service records dating back to 2004 show that the rod bearing recall was performed at 35k miles and that under warranty, a replacement transmission was installed at 41k miles. Regular maintenance is reported to have been performed at or before the suggested intervals, including oil, transmission, and differential fluid changes. The Vanos system received a clean bill of health during the most recent valve adjustment and a diagram showing valve clearances prior to adjustment is shown in the gallery below, along with the results from the recent PPI.",
      "Photos of the undercarriage can be seen in the gallery below.",
      "The included Carfax shows five previous owners and no prior accidents or damage. The original trunk lid, original suspension components, brake calipers, original door cards, and a BMW car cover are all included in the sale.",

Around $13k in service receipts document maintenance performed since the car\u2019s warranty terms expired. Modifications include the installation of a CSL-style front air valance. Work included the rear subframe repair, replacement of driveline seals, a new SMG pump, and a $1200 Inspection II service. This 2004 E46 M3 SMG is sold with service records, a Carfax report, and a clean Illinois title.",

The seller recently had the car polished, and notes that is has been garaged and was exclusively street-driven to their knowledge. Parking distance control sensors were optioned at purchase.",
      "The front bumper cover has been replaced with a CSL style piece. 19\u2033 Style 135 paired-spoke alloys show a few areas of light curb wear and wear Goodyear Eagle F1 tires measuring 245/35 up front and 275/30 out back. The optional Lighting Package includes Xenon headlights and washers, which were deleted with the installation of the new bumper cover.",
      "The interior is finished in Imola Red leather with a black dash and carpeting. Light creasing and bolster flattening is visible on both front seats. Interior options include a center armrest, a tinted power moonroof, and hi-fi audio with a 6-disc CD changer. A recall on the driver\u2019s airbag is outstanding. Around 87k miles are shown on the digital odometer.",

Other highlights provided by the seller include the replacement of the timing chain, spark plugs, valve cover gasket, pinion replacement, and a power steering pressure line at 70k miles; an SMG pump replaced under warranty at 40k miles; and a tire replacement. The brake rotors and pads have recently been replaced by the seller, who states that service receipts for work performed since the end of the warranty period total around $13k.",
      "The seller has included a collection of photographs documenting the underside condition. The 2014 work invoice shown in the gallery notes a crack found in a rear subframe mount that was resolved with a Turner motorsports kit.",
      "Reciepts for work conducted since the expiration of the warranty period are said to total around $13k. A recent Carfax describes an accident-free history under previous owners in Maryland, Kentucky, and Ohio."

This E46 M3 is described as almost entirely unmodified, and it is sold with a clean Carfax report, original literature, and a clear North Carolina title in the seller\u2019s name.",
      "Sheet metal is finished in Stahlgrau (steel grey) Metallic paint, which is shown up close in photos along with glass, badging, and lighting. Blemishes are reportedly limited to chips in the nose and a minor ding in the driver-side rear wheel arch as detailed in the gallery below. No accidents or paintwork are noted on the included Carfax report.",

Original side marker lights have given way to amber LED units but are included in the sale. All other trim and accessories remain stock according to the seller.",
      "Powered front sport seats show condition commensurate with the mileage, with light entry and egress wear on driver-side bolsters and a scuff on the passenger-side lower cushion. The seller replaced peeling A and C-pillar fabric with new material from BMW, as well as installing a new auto-dimming rearview mirror due to typical distortion in the original. The car was ordered with a sunroof but without heated seats or navigation.",
      "Instrumentation includes a 185 mph speedo and a digital odometer showing just over 43k miles, approximately 1,000 of which have been added by the seller. A factory CD player remains in place and interior lighting is shown to work in photos, including backlit pixels on the driver information and HVAC displays. A Takata passenger-side airbag recall was recently carried out. The seller notes that the tire pressure monitoring system light illuminates intermittently.",
      "The 3.2-liter S54 inline-six was rated at 333 horsepower for the US market and is paired here with a 6-speed manual transmission. A synthetic oil change was carried out in October 2017 along with replacement of the front struts with OEM Bilsteins. No rear subframe reinforcement has been required according to the seller. A handful of underbody photos are shown below.",
      "The Carfax report shows a steady progression of mileage over three owners including the seller and indicates no accidents, thefts, or other issues. A recent inspection performed by a Raleigh-area BMW dealer reportedly determined the car to be in good working order, including the VANOS variable valve timing system and rod bearings. The rear differential TSB was addressed with updated fluid.",
      "The sale includes original manuals along with a factory audio demonstration CD, two keys with remote fobs, a valet key, and a plastic emergency key. The factory air compressor and towing hardware remain present in the trunk. The car was purchased with the intention of longterm ownership, but a change of plans reportedly forces the sale. The seller encourages questions and is able to help arrange shipping details for the winning bidder."

The seller purchased the car on BaT in June 2017 and recently took a new job overseas, which is forcing the sale. Power comes from a 3.2-liter S54 inline-six paired to a six-speed manual gearbox, and modifications include a set of 19\u201d ZCP alloys, Eibach springs, Active Autowerke exhaust, and a Rasp pipe. Factory options include a rear spoiler delete, Bi-Xenon headlamps, and a Harmon/Kardon stereo. This E46 M3 is now being offered with numerous service records from new, the original window sticker, a clean Carfax, and a clear Virginia title in the seller\u2019s name.",
      "No history of prior accidents or damage are shown on the included Carfax, and the Steel Grey Metallic finish presents well in photos. The front bumper has been refinished by a previous owner in response to stone chips, although new chips from highway driving are present, and a small scratch is visible on the passenger-side rear fender.",
      "Ride height has been lowered with a set of Eibach springs, and the genuine 19\u2033 ZCP alloys were installed in 2016.",
      "The interior features Cinnamon leather upholstery, and all gauges, lights, and the optional Harmon/Kardon sound system are reported to work as intended. Per the seller, the fore and aft adjustment on the driver seat is currently sticking and the headliner is beginning to sag slightly around the pillars.",
      "The S54 3.2-liter inline-six has been modified with an Active Autowerke Exhaust and Rogue Engineering Rasp Pipe. A Full Inspection II was performed along with a valve adjustment at 25k miles, and the rod bearing recall was addressed at 2k miles. Servicing under the previous owner was performed each spring annually. In June 2017 just prior to the seller\u2019s acquisition the local BMW dealer performed a multi-point inspection, as well as an oil and filter change, brake fluid flush, front airbag recall replacement, power steering fluid flush, headlight adjustment, windshield wiper fluid pump replacement, and four-wheel alignment.",
      "The included Carfax can be viewed in the gallery below, along with the original window sticker, and various receipts. Two factory keys and the original exhaust are included with the sale. There is a failed inspection noted on the Carfax, and this was due to the painted front reflectors not passing the safety inspection. OEM amber reflectors are included with the sale, though the black painted ones are currently installed."

      "This 2003 BMW M3 coupe shows just under 20k miles and was sold new at Rick Hill BMW in Kingsport, Tennessee. Finished in Alpine White over a black Nappa leather interior with aluminum trim, this car was optioned from the factory with the Premium and Cold Weather packages, Xenon headlights, Harmon-Kardon sound, 19\u2033 light alloy wheels, and more. The 3.2-liter S54 inline-six is backed by a 6-speed manual transmission, and AC Schnitzer aluminum pedal covers have been fitted. The seller acquired the car in January 2018 from the second owner and has since added 300 miles. The fuel sending unit, rear pinion seal, and right rear axle seal were recently replaced, and this E46 M3 is now being offered with service records, the owner\u2019s manual, an accident-free Carfax, and a clear South Carolina title in the seller\u2019s name.",
      "The car is finished in Alpine White, and no accident or other damage are noted on the included Carfax. The seller states that rock chips on the passenger side of the hood were previously retouched, and exterior imperfections are shown in the gallery. A complete clay bar and two-stage wax process has been preformed by the seller.",
      "All brake rotors and pads were replaced in 2015, and a brake fluid flush was performed at the same time. The seller notes some oxidation on the center of the optional 19\u2033 Light Alloy wheels, and Continental ContiSportContact tires are fitted at all four corners.",
      "The interior is finished in black Nappa leather with aluminum trim. The heated front seats have lumbar support and adjustable seat width. AC Schnitzer aluminum pedal covers were previously installed.",
      "Optional interior equipment includes a Harmon-Kardon sound system, glass moonroof, and a rear seat ski bag. All lights and accessories are reported to work as they should, and the odometer shows just under 20k miles.",
      "The 3.2-liter S54 inline-six is reportedly unmodified and is mated to a 6-speed manual transmission. The BMW low mileage service was completed in 2015 at 17,064 miles, along with replacing the power steering pump and completing the Takata passenger airbag recall. Work completed in January 2018 at Hilton Head BMW included replacing the fuel sending unit, rear pinion seal, right rear axle seal, and a general inspection.",
      "Several additional undercarriage images are included in the gallery below.",
      "The accident-free Carfax shows two previous owners and that the car spent time in Tennessee and South Carolina. A inconsistency is shown in 2015 that is believed to be a mileage entry error by the seller. The owner\u2019s manual, booklets, and two keys are included."

Factory options consist of bi-xenon headlamps, the Cold Weather Package, a Harman Kardon stereo, the Premium Package, and width-adjustable seats. The seller has owned six E46 M3s including this car, which he acquired around one year ago. Power comes from a 3.2-liter S54 inline-six paired to a 6-speed manual transmission, and modifications include painted front reflectors along with a set of 19\u2033 Competition Package wheels. The seller has changed the engine oil, transmission fluid, differential fluid, filters, and installed a new battery himself. This low-mile BMW is now offered with recent parts receipts, factory books, both keys, a clear Carfax, and a clean Massachusetts title in the seller\u2019s name.",
      "The exterior is finished in Imola Red, and the seller believes that no past paintwork has occurred based on depth meter readings. The Carfax shows no history of accidents or other damage. The previous owner had the car for nine and a half years and reportedly kept it garaged during that time.",
      "A set of OEM 19\u2033 alloys from an E46 M3 Competition Package have been installed and are fitted with Bridgestone Potenza RE050A tires sized 245/35 up front and 275/30 in the rear.",

      "Currently the digital odometer shows just 21,917 miles. The seller has added around 1,500 miles over the past year.",
      "According to BMW, the 3.2-liter S54 inline-six produced 333 horsepower at 7,900 rpm and 262 lb-ft of torque at 4,900 rpm when new. The previous owner reportedly performed annual oil changes himself. Likewise, the seller has also maintained the car himself, including changes of the engine oil, transmission fluid, and differential fluid, plus a new fuel filter, engine and cabin air filters, and a new battery. All work was performed in June 2017, and associated parts receipts are pictured in the gallery below.",
      "Per the accident-free Carfax, this M3 was sold new in Ohio and stayed in state until the seller purchased and moved the vehicle to Massachusetts in 2017. Consistent odometer readings and five service history records are also displayed."

The car was optioned from the factory with park distance control, a Harmon Kardon sound system, and the premium package. Recent servicing included installing an OEM fuel pump, fuel filter, new spark plugs, and oxygen sensors. This E46 is now being offered with receipts for the build reportedly totaling $75k, a Ninjaneering laptop, a CSL carbon fiber trunk, a clean Carfax, and a clean Texas title in the seller\u2019s name.",

Further modifications include a Zionsville radiator with electric fans, a MoTeC M150 ECU with CAN integration, a Macht Schnell intake, VAC-coated rod bearings, a group 48 battery, a Vengeance Customs carbon fiber intake system, and a carbon fiber ECU cover. Per the seller, all eight fuel injectors were bench-flowed and include new seals. The MoTeC ECU is not OBD2 compliant and no catalytic converters are present.",
      "The 6-speed manual gearbox is installed using AKG transmission mounts and power is sent to 3.85 limited slip differential. The subframe was reinforced using new plates, AKG differential mounts and OEM subframe bushings. Additional upgraded components include AKG motor mounts, a Dinan exhaust with custom 2.5\u2033 piping to a Boost logic X-pipe, and AKG rear trailing arm bushings. A UUC front sway bar was fitted in order to clear the oil pan.",

Clear protective film is applied to the hood, front bumper, and forward sections of the fenders. Pitting is noted on the headlight lenses and windshield, and the underside of the front bumper cover shows vestiges of previous scuffing.",
      "Style 67 19\u2033 wheels were refinished at 25k miles and are said to be free of curb rash. Michelin Pilot Super Sport tires measure 225/40 in the front and 255/35 out back. Optional xenon headlights with washers are equipped as well as a power sunroof.",

      "The seller states that interior equipment functions properly and has provided close-up photos of the display pixels, rearview mirror, and plastic surfaces. A DICE media bridge enables Bluetooth syncing and auxiliary inputs while retaining use of the factory audio equipment. Wiring for an Escort radar detector with remote control is also present. The digital odometer shows just over 45k miles.",

Cars from the 2004 model year received updated components and were exempt from the rod bearing recall afflicting earlier years. This example was dealer serviced until 2012, with most subsequent work performed by Co\u2019s BMW in Loveland and A&B Import Auto in Fort Collins, Colorado. A service at 31k miles included a valve adjustment, replacement of the clutch delay valve, and Inspection II. The accessory drive belt was replaced in 2017 and an Inspection I was recently completed by the selling dealer.",

Service appointments with dealers and independent shops are reported along with a mileage discrepancy of 2,567 miles in 2005, though mileage reports remain consistent before and after. The selling dealer reports that this error was likely due to the timing of the transfer from the corporate to private owner in Colorado. The Carfax also reports the clutch being replaced at 31,000 miles, but the actual service receipt shows a clutch delay valve delete. A walk-around video can be seen below."

      "This 2006 BMW M3 Coupe is a non-sunroof car equipped with the Competition Package and finished in Carbon Black Metallic over Cinnamon leather. The seller has owned the car for eight years, and the odometer now shows just under 41k miles. Power comes from a 3.2-liter S54 inline-six paired with a 6-speed SMG transmission. According to the seller, this E46 has been kept stock throughout and is a lightly-optioned example without a factory navigation system. This M3 is now being offered in Missouri with recent service records, factory manuals, three keys, a clear Carfax, and a clean Illinois title in the seller\u2019s name.",
      "BMW\u2019s Carbon Black Metallic paint appears very dark blue when exposed to sunlight, and the provided Carfax shows no history of accidents or other damage. One scratch on the passenger-side front fender is pointed out in the photo gallery below.",
      "The 19\u2033 Competition Package alloy wheels are fitted with Continental ExtremeContact tires, and the factory braking system includes cross drilled rotors.",
      "Inside, the Cinnamon leather upholstery is accented with aluminum trim on the door pulls and dashboard. This particular M3 is not fitted with a sunroof or in-dash navigation system.",
      "Competition Package cars came equipped with an Alcantara-rimmed steering wheel as shown above. Manual shifting of the SMG transmission can be performed via paddles attached to the steering wheel or via the gear lever itself. The seller states that he has added approximately 20k miles over the past eight years, and the digital odometer currently shows just under 41k miles.",
      "The S54 3.2-liter inline-six has been kept stock and produced 333 horsepower at 7,900 rpm and 262 lb-ft of torque at 4,900 rpm when new. Invoices for dealer-performed 30k-mile and 40k-mile services are included with the sale.",
      "Engine start-up and driving videos can be viewed above.",
      "Additional undercarriage photos are displayed in the gallery below.",
      "The accident-free Carfax was run on June 19, 2018 and shows two owners including the seller. The car appears to have spent the majority of its life in Illinois, and a number of service history records are also provided."

      "Several photos of the underside are included in the gallery. Records are said to document consistent maintenance performed at BMW service centers from new aside from oil changes, which were performed by the owner at 6500-mile intervals with BMW oil. Also accompanying the car are upgrade receipts, the original window sticker, books and manuals, period literature, three sets of keys, and a spare set of headlight surrounds.",
      "The Carfax report shows no history of accidents and verifies the one-owner history. There is an outstanding recall for the Takata-equipped airbag that the seller will have addressed if the part becomes available before the new owner takes delivery."

      "This 2006 BMW M3 is finished in Interlagos Blue over black Nappa leather and is equipped with the Competition, Premium, and Cold Weather packages. Reportedly built during the final day of E46 M3 production, this well-optioned example was leased from new and subsequently purchased as a Certified Pre-Owned Vehicle by the previous owner out of New York. The car has been driven approximately 14k of its 53k indicated miles since it was acquired by the seller and brought to Florida in April 2016. Service records date to new and include a preventative overhaul of the VANOS system 3k miles ago, as well as an Inspection II that was completed at 40k miles. The car benefits from a recent paint correction and ceramic coating, and an oil change was performed less than 1k miles ago. This E46 M3 is now being offered for sale with records from new, a car cover, clean Carfax and AutoCheck reports, and a clean Florida title in the seller\u2019s name.",
      "Interlagos Blue was offered exclusively on M3s equipped with the ZCP Competition Package. Paint correction was performed in March, and a ceramic coating was also applied to the finish. According to the seller, the driver\u2019s door was repainted approximately eight years ago after the vehicle was keyed. No accidents are listed on the included Carfax or AutoCheck reports, and the car was reportedly stored in a climate-controlled garage during winters on Long Island.",
      "Staggered-width 19\u201d cross-spoke alloy wheels are wrapped in Hankook Ventus V12 tires. Larger cross-drilled rotors and an upgraded steering rack came standard as part of the Competition Package.",
      "Black Nappa leather seats are powered and heated and show some light creasing on the driver\u2019s outer bolster. Interior options include aluminum trim, a sunroof, and a navigation system. The Alcantara-wrapped steering wheel is equipped with a \u201cTrack Mode\u201d button that raises the threshold of the Dynamic Stability Control. The driver and passenger airbag recall was reportedly addressed by the seller.",
      "An illuminated shift knob from an F10 M5 has been added, and the factory stereo and CD changer are retained. 53k miles are shown on the digital odometer, approximately 14k of which have been added during the seller\u2019s two-year ownership.",
      "The 3.2-liter S54 inline-six produced 333 horsepower at 7,900 rpm and 262 lb-ft of torque at 4,900 rpm when new. Recent maintenance included a new valve cover gasket, power steering reservoir O-ring, clutch and brake fluid, and an oil change. Records date to new and are said to cover a preventative overhaul of the VANOS system at 50k miles, an Inspection II at 40k miles, as well as receipts documenting a new chain tensioner guide, cam gear bolts, serpentine belts, and more.",
      "Additional undercarriage photos are viewable in the gallery.",
      "A provided Carfax shows no issues and lists history in New York and Florida. According to the seller, the first and second owners are the same individual, who purchased the car as a CPO vehicle following the conclusion of his lease."

The seller reports that the non-stock flywheel causes transmission gears to rattle at idle, and the RPMs to dip when the A/C compressor turn ons. Recent service in March 2018 included oil changes for the engine, transmission, and differential.",
      "The chassis has been modified with TC Klein single adjustable coil-overs, a Turner strut bar strut bar, and front sway bar from Ground Control. The brakes were recently serviced with new front and rear brake pads.",
      "Several removed OEM parts come with the sale including the coil overs, sway bar, flywheel and clutch.",

      "This 2006 BMW M3 Convertible has 97k miles and is finished in Imola Red over black with a black soft top. Purchased by the seller in May 2017, the car is powered by a 3.2-liter S54 inline-six paired with a 6-speed manual transmission. Interior equipment includes heated and powered front sport seats with memory, a multi-function leather steering wheel, navigation, auto-dimming interior and exterior mirrors, BMW Assist with Bluetooth, and BMW Park Distance Control (PDC) system. Maintenance performed since May 2017 included new VANOS filter and seals, a new fuel pump, new A/C drive belt, new spark plugs and coils, new battery, and more as described below. This E46 is being sold with partial service records, a Carfax report, and a clear Colorado title.",
      "Finished in Imolarot 2 (405), this M3 features black Plasti Dip front and side grilles. The soft top shows some wear near the fold points but is reportedly functional, and the seller replaced the trunk lid due to holes from a removed spoiler. Both rear quarters, the new lid, and the new lip spoiler were repainted, and the seller notes a panel gap on the passenger side of the new trunk lid. The front bumper, fenders, and hood are described as having been repainted at some point in the past. Damage reported on the Carfax is the reportedly the result of a sandstorm which pitted the leading edges with rock chips, which was not repaired.",
      "The windshield has been replaced, and factory options include xenon headlamps and fog lights. A crack is visible on the underside of the front bumper, which is shown in the gallery along with several scrapes on the underside of the bumper and belly pan. Air hammer marks are noted on the passenger-side rear quarter panel, which the seller believes is the result of a possible collision damage repair.",
      "Both front lower control arm assemblies were replaced in 2017 and the brake calipers have been powder coated red. Some curb rash and minor discoloration are noted on the replacement 18\u2033 BMW Style 67 wheels. Sumitomo HTR A/S P02 tires measure 225/40 up front and 255/35 at the rear. A large ding is noted under the right rear taillamp, which also has six inoperable LEDs and condensation. The seller notes discoloration of the original seals and black trim near the windshield cowl and wiper arms.",
      "The black Nappa leather interior features heated and powered front sports seats with memory, and brushed aluminum trim is found on the door panels, dashboard, and center console. Seams on the outer driver\u2019s bolster are said to be failing and show some discoloration. Discoloration is also noted on the steering wheel leather and the shift knob, which is missing a piece of leather. The electric power windows are reportedly functional, with the auto-up feature occasionally triggering an anti-trap warning. The tint on the driver\u2019s window is scratched and the front passenger-side window is said to rattle when fully rolled up. Side mirror glass is beginning to delaminate.",
      "The digital odometer shows 97k miles, 5,100 of which were added by the seller. This car is equipped with a multi-function leather steering wheel, navigation, auto-dimming interior and exterior mirrors, BMW Assist with Bluetooth, and BMW Park Distance Control (PDC) system. The seller notes that the left front midrange door speaker is blown and that the parking brake is in need of adjustment. A Harmon Kardon audio system with a 6-disc CD changer is equipped, and the seller has added an auxiliary jack and hardwired iPhone charger.",
      "Power comes from a 3.2-liter S54 inline-six paired with a 6-speed manual transmission and Dynamic Stability Control. The seller claims that he performed Inspection II services during the course of ownership, with the exception of a valve adjustment. A Blackstone oil analysis was performed in March 2018 and a readout of the results is included in the gallery below. Other maintenance items completed since May 2017 included replacement of shifter bushings (apart from those directly above the bell housing), a new VANOS filter and seals, a new fuel pump and relay, a new A/C drive belt, a Time-Sert drain plug repair, new spark plugs and coils, a new lower radiator hose, a new temperature sensor, a new high-pressure expansion tank cap, a new battery, and new cabin and engine air filters. The seller notes that the left valve cover is seeping, and service records covering the seller\u2019s ownership are included with the sale.",
      "The Carfax report shows consistent mileage readings, initial registration in California, and reported damage to the front end of the car in May 2018. Though six owners are shown, the seller claims this is a clerical error as he is reportedly the fifth owner. An active lien is shown, but the seller states that the loan was paid off in April 2018 and that he holds a clear Colorado title in his name. The car is being sold with one key and a partially complete factory tool kit.",
      "A video showing the interior is provided above and additional clips can be found on the seller\u2019s YouTube channel."

      "This 2004 BMW M3 Convertible is finished in Carbon Black Metallic over Cinnamon leather and shows approximately 66k miles. Power comes from a stock 3.2L S54 inline-six paired to a 6-speed manual gearbox. Originally purchased at Herb Chambers BMW in Boston, Massachusetts, the car was resold as a CPO vehicle in 2007, remaining in the state under various owners until 2013 when a previous owner relocated it to Florida. The North Carolina-based seller acquired the car in June 2018 and has driven under 200 miles, performing a mechanical inspection and some minor cosmetic repairs. Airbag and DME programming recalls have been completed, and this particular car was not included in the rod bearing recall campaign. This E46 M3 is now offered with a clean Carfax, a readout of dealership maintenance, owner\u2019s books, receipts for recent service, and a clean North Carolina title.",

The seller notes that the car has been garage kept during his ownership.",

      "This 2005 BMW M3 coupe is finished in Silver Grey Metallic over a black leather interior and shows 52k miles. The car was first sold in May 2005 at Habberstad BMW in Huntington Station, New York, and has been registered in that state and New Jersey since. Power is from a 3.2-liter S54 inline-six paired with a 6-speed manual transmission, and factory options include the Premium and Cold Weather packages, xenon headlights, Bluetooth, and Harman Kardon sound. The seller purchased the car in September 2017 from its previous owner of eight years and has since adjusted the valves, installed a modified VANOS oil pump disk and seals from Beisan Systems, replaced the serpentine and A/C belts, and changed the fluids as well as installing 19\u2033 ZCP wheels and painting the front reflectors. This E46 M3 underwent an airbag recall in 2017 and is now offered with a clean Carfax report, manuals, and a clear New Jersey title in the seller\u2019s name.",
      "The exterior is finished in Silver Grey Metallic (A08) and features an optional power sunroof, rain-sensing windshield wipers, and bi-xenon headlights with washers. The seller had both bumpers repainted, which included removing the license-plate holes on the front. The rest of the paint is said to have received correction and ceramic coating.",
      "The car was recently equipped with Competition Package 19\u2033 wheels, which wear Michelin Pilot Sport tires size 225/40 front and 255/35 rear and dated from 2008. The seller also installed chrome-coated front turn signal bulbs and painted front bumper reflectors.",
      "The black-trimmed cabin features heated power seats with adjustable lumbar support and side bolsters as well as Titan Shadow interior trim, automatic climate control, and a Harman Kardon sound system. The auto-dimming rearview mirror was repaired in 2014, and both Takata-supplied front airbags were replaced in 2017 due to a recall.",
      "Just over 52,100 miles are shown on the digital odometer, approximately 800 of which were added by the seller. In recent weeks the seller replaced the driver-side armrest trim, the center console, the A- and C-pillar trim, and the M door sills. Two remote keys are included and shown in the gallery, along with a leather BMW key pouch.",
      "The 3.2L S54 inline-six produced 333 horsepower at 7,900 rpm and 262 lb-ft of torque at 4,900 rpm from the factory. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a 6-speed manual gearbox.",
      "The seller states that he personally performed the equivalent of a BMW Inspection II service in March of this year, which is documented with additional photos below. A VANOS kit from Beisan Systems was installed during the valve adjustment procedure, with updated BMW cam bolts secured with Loctite and the VANOS solenoid pack cleaned. Other elements of the service are said to have included fresh fluids for the engine, transmission, differential, and power steering as well as the cooling and braking systems. The seller also replaced the engine mounts, spark plugs, serpentine and A/C belts, valve cover gasket and grommets, and windshield wiper assemblies as well as the air, fuel, and cabin filters.",
      "An invoice shows that the control arms and their bushings were replaced at 37k miles by Competition BMW of Smithtown in Saint James, New York. Additional photos of the underside are available in the gallery below, including labeled images of the rear subframe attachment points.",
      "The Carfax report documents no accidents or other damage and shows New York state inspections as well as consistent mileage readings.",
      "The seller is including binders containing service records and photos from his ownership, a flash drive with digital versions of the photos, factory literature, and a spare key."

      "This 2001 BMW M3 Convertible has spent its life in New Jersey and was purchased by a member of the seller\u2019s family in 2012. The seller acquired it in September 2017 and the odometer now shows 95k miles. The car is finished in Laguna Seca Blue with a color-matched hardtop over grey leather upholstery. Power comes from a 3.2L S54 inline-six paired to a 6-speed manual transmission. Features include a set of lowering springs and an Alcantara steering wheel rim. This E46 M3 is now offered with service receipts from the previous owner, a hardtop stand, factory manuals, one key, a clear Carfax, and a clean New Jersey title in the seller\u2019s name.",
      "Laguna Seca Blue was an added-cost option for the E46 M3, and this particular convertible came equipped with a factory hardtop as shown above. Per the seller, cosmetic blemishes include scuffs on the front bumper low corners plus a ding on the driver\u2019s side rear quarter panel, as highlighted in the gallery below. The included Carfax does not list any accidents or other damage.",
      "This M3 sits lower than stock on a set of aftermarket springs. 18\u2033 wheels are mounted with 225/40 front and 265/35 rear Falken Azenis RT615K tires. Each corner is detailed up-close in the gallery.",
      "Inside, this M3 is optioned with a Harman Kardon sound system, heated seats, and dark trim on the door pulls, center console, and dashboard face. An aftermarket Alcantara steering wheel rim is equipped as shown above. Per the seller, the hazard light switch and interior door lock switch are both inoperable, though the locks function correctly via the key fob or door handle lock itself.",
      "This M3 is powered by a 3.2L S54 inline-six, which is mated to a 6-speed manual transmission and developed 333 horsepower and 262 lb-ft of torque when new. A valve adjustment was completed in 2013 by Maximum PSI in Linden, New Jersey. Several parts receipts and an in-process picture of the valve adjustment are displayed in the gallery. The previous owner was a mechanic, who reportedly completed other maintenance themselves.",
      "The accident-free Carfax lists New Jersey registration from new and a handful of service history records."

The 3.2-liter S54 inline-six is mated to a 6-speed sequential gearbox and has been modified with a carbon-fiber air intake, ECU tune, and an Epic Motorsports exhaust header. A custom livery and #88 adorn the exterior, along with carbon-fiber aero components. The interior has been stripped and fitted with a welded-in cage, Recaro racing seats, and an AiM data display and logging system. The car has taken part in 15-20 track days since completion of the build, and the seller estimates it has approximately 75k miles. Recent service included new fluids and a resealing of the VANOS system. The car is registered as non-operative as it is not legal for street use. This E46 track car is now offered with build records, a pre-purchase inspection, and a clean California title in the seller\u2019s name.",
      "The exterior is finished with a white, blue, and black patterned livery, with logos promoting Performance Technic and the Alisa Ann Ruch Burn Foundation. BimmerWorld provided the carbon fiber front splitter, riser, canards, and headlight-delete blanks. The driver\u2019s headlight blank doubles as an intake for the engine, and the BimmerWorld brake ducting is fitted in place of the fog lights. Additional downforce comes from the Aero Motions adjustable carbon fiber rear wing.",
      "The door windows were replaced with quick-connect window netting, and plexiglass is installed in place of the rear side windows. The sunroof has been removed and the opening capped with a riveted blank. 18\u2033 BC Forged wheels measure 10\u2033 wide at all four corners and are mounted via studs. The Toyo Proxes RR tires show 2014 date codes, and a set of roller wheels and tires is included in the sale.",
      "The upholstery and carpets have been removed from the interior, including the insulation and adhesive. The air conditioning system and heater core were removed and the plumbing was capped. Both door panels were removed and cable pull straps were installed. A welded-in cage is integrated with the strut towers and features door bars, a dashboard cross bar, A and B-pillar wraps, and reinforcement of the rear subframe. The Recaro driver\u2019s seat is equipped with a Schroth 5-point harness and provisions for a HANS device. The removable Recaro passenger seat is also equipped with a 5-point harness. Additional amenities include a fire suppression system, an extra-wide rearview mirror, and a F.A.S.T. Cool Suit System with an unused shirt.",
      "The factory dashboard was reinstalled on top of the cage, and block-off plates for removed items provides space for added switches. Other features include a tilt-up steering wheel, a push-button start, and an electrical kill switch.",
      "Instrumentation was replaced with an AiM MXG panel with GPS and data logging. An AiM SmartyCam overlays data on the recorded driving video, which can be seen above. Note that the driver lost his left arm and leg in an accident as a child, and thus is only driving with his right hand. The seller states that the electronic gauge sometimes does not display the proper gear, though other instrumentation is correct and the gearbox is not to blame for the error.",
      "The 3.2-liter S54 inline-six is equipped with a carbon fiber air-intake, Epic Motorsport 100 octane ECU tune, and an Epic Motorsports exhaust header. The seller estimates output to be 345 horsepower at the rear wheels via the 6-speed SMG transmission. Cooling has been upgraded with a larger Fluidyne radiator, a larger oil cooler, and a larger electric fan. A BimmerWorld Race muffler and resonator reportedly allow for operation under 104 decibels, but a straight pipe is included in the sale. Service in January 2019 included a Beisan VANOS reseal kit, as well as new fluids for the engine, gearbox, differential, and power steering.",

The car will not pass California emissions testing and as a result cannot be sold to a buyer who plans to register the car in California. Maintenance in June 2019 reportedly consisted of a new water pump, thermostat, radiator hoses, radiator, supercharger belt, A/C belt, alternator, valve cover gasket, spark plugs, ignition coils, and fluid changes.",

The selling dealer has added about 3k miles since acquiring the car in 2017, and upgraded brakes from ECS Tuning have been installed as well as a Turner Motorsports rear subframe reinforcement kit. This E46 M3 was previously auctioned on BaT and is being offered again by the same dealer in New Jersey with service records dating back to 2011, a clean AutoCheck report, and a clean Massachusetts title.",

      "Features include a Harman Kardon sound system, an in-dash CD player, heated seats, a sunroof, ski bag, armrest, rain sensing wipers, and navigation. Per the seller, the steering wheel has recently been replaced.",
      "The 3.2-liter S54 inline-six is paired with a 6-speed manual transmission and produced 333 horsepower and 262 ft-lb of torque when new. The rear subframe mounts were recently repaired and reinforced by European Auto in Oceanside, New York using a kit from Turner Motorsports, and the associated invoice and photos are provided in the gallery below. Replacement components installed since 2011 also include the following:",
